i know, i know, i'm white. but i don't even hear it. obv it exists. but largely a media/machine concept at this point. to distract
the magic of trump, and i'll admit he's talented, is that he gets ppl to co-sign on heinous stuff under the guise of "america 1st"
i wish their secondary could have been tested by a competent qb

damn straight
blood clot in brain: fine now debilitating cough: allergies carried after a collapse: just heat but you can totally trust she's fit to lead!
and that's what they admit! god knows what they are hiding
they need to work something out, this whole situation is retarded.
their biggest fear is user manipulation of certain trophies with the use of mods. dead serious.
the cowboys got the redskins after a monday night loss on a short week. now they get the bears after a monday night loss on a short week
and the bears have gotten pretty beaten up tonight.
i'm going to see if my place offers it but i think they only do regular physical therapy

who the chicago tribune reporters picked in this game (h/t , )

fair question but majority of aussies not actively religious; only a fraction of religious minority bigoted.
true. yet conservatives have hijacked “christian” while christian churches stay silent &amp; let acl lead
when men claiming to be women put out statements like this ""my heels are a political statement" one has to choke.
make statements of spectrum, non binary and many more including transgendered identity. awareness + acceptance for u,me+them!

no it's the distain people have for hillary clinton they look at the media in the same light and nothing worst than a liar
most about mexican, blacks what have you got to lose, most about muslims, which wasn't is easier..
what was racist about anything he said?
jimmy fallon thinks its funny that we have a disgusting racist misogynist insane piece of shit running 4 president. ur pathetic
he'll also have hillary on and she's responsible for killing thousands of civilians in drone attacks.
make help the culture of communities.
hillary is winning! why? she puts kids first. she has good ethics. it is also why she is made an object of scorn by some.

...i don't mean where he was born, but how islam influenced his thinking &amp; loyalties.
trumps economic spiel is not a plan, its a bunch of unattainable goals that would blowup deficit &amp; debt 4 the rch
you don't know what your talking about
seems like a good folo question would be, "mr. trump, why did obama have to prove his citizenship to you?"
good answer: because potus works for people, they are his boss, and can make any demands they deem fit.

she's sickening!! i mean her skin is so rich, body so fluid, and she radiates.
the media are finally acknowledging trump was not making fun of a disabled reporter. they owe him an apology.
ur twitter profile says mom and not worst mom on planet. may wanna switch that.
lol will be pleased :p
who is this sob &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; just blocked me. never even talked him once. so many insecure people
why doesn't trump's wife ever appearance with him? only his daughter. odd.
dumps wife is an illegal alien. she's hiding in the shadows like so many others of her kind.
this is why the scotus argument for trump doesn't hold water. if reagan couldn't be trusted.....
judges are supposed to follow law they're lawless when they don't.problem =our lawmakers/congress refuse to amend it &amp; fund it

how can you explain trump's refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of the current president other than a desire to please racist supporters?
he actually believes it too
the shiny object slipped past the media,warts and all. racism/bigotry/hate,all given a pass.the country's well was poisoned for a generation

instead of driving jobs and wealth away, america will become the world's great magnet for innovation &amp; job creation!

good luck w/your hopeful assist on the hillary "refresh" button narrative. where are bank speech transcripts?she needs to reset trust.
do you realize that needly picky nibbling at trump,silence on clinton's unwillingness 2 share speech transcripts = virtual/moral tie?
not easy for trump to flip on birtherism:1. supporters believe it 2. never admits error 3. have to admit he didnt believe what he was saying
your continued statements supporting hillary and undermining gop will eject you to wilderness after election. bon voyage.
daily kos is a dumb site. no one is going to get good #'s until they include 3rd party!

didn't nbc learn anything after allowing trump to host snl? did anyone actually think jimmy fallon would be hard on him? i mean, honestly.
its a comedy show, why would he be hard on him?
cnn poll of polls: clinton leads trump by 2 points, which means it's a tie. all trend lines moving toward trump.

when i cast my vote 4 hillary i will leave the polling station knowing i made the best decision 4 commander-in-chief

"i'm sorry" is never a complete sentence, is it? it's either "i'm sorry, and ..." or "i'm sorry, but...." or ugh, "i'm sorry, okay?????????"
to me, "i'm sorry, and..." is the only right way to sorry. i don't even like "i'm sorry full stop." because there's a reason you're sorry.
“nothing in the world is more exciting than a moment of sudden discovery or invention ..."

what will bernie sanders do if trump wins? "try to overcome my depression" and "figure out where we go from there"
how much damage can trump do over 4 years? despoil the environment. check. create huge deficits. check. market crash. check....

trump! what could go wrong? his voodoo economics creates market crash, recession. for starters.
so the prophet pbuh himself negotiating with the jews that lived at the time, what does that make him? 🤔
such ignorance. appalling that these creatures have the audacity to question people's faith because of a bloody pic.
happy birthday 🎉 have a good one 😊

trump still creates loophole that goes beyond ryan plan to cut rates on biz income to 15%, letting trump pay lower rate than many families.
twenty four hours later, i still stand by this prebuttal tweet 👇
yes "of the two humans who can be physically elected president, vote for the one you like better" is real radical.
right and they don't have to earn that. they just stand around like a show horse
the sleeping giant has awakened ! blacks are not voting for hillary !
rightly so..dems just want the vote.look at chicag.etc. trump is a negotiator who wins and gets things done

hormoneless tweeting endocrinology bites behind unseen curves i am truly on the fence today. menopause w/ no ovaries
no one told me there would be days like this. the endo says 'catastrophic' as they can't prescribe what's gone 4now
to point out where we are this am. with bated breath, we're waiting for someone to confirm they think is an actual us citizen.
you media folks have given trump such a low bar and pass and gone out the way to damage hrc. please don't act concerned now.
no. he clearly is doing this for himself. his entire manner in this race should make this fully obvious to you.
what is obvious to me is that he has the characteristics of a strong leader n part of that is having a strong sense of self.
she is not worthy of our votes sir.to many lies told .trump may not be the best pick but he sure knows how to reach us.
with lies. read politicususa or politifact to know what's true &amp; what isn't. you owe it to yourself &amp; america.

so, friends of privilege (and this is intersectional, you can have non black privilege w/o white privilege, male but not able-bodied, etc.)
donald trump has by turns praised and vilified the fed chair, janet yellen, and the fed’s interest-rate policies.
the trump crash is coming. voodoo economics, deficit spending, drastic spending cuts will spur the sell off. make america kansas!
krauthammer: 'this is an election about nothing'
kraut is a has been totally wrong since beginning

replace insurance status with education or income and you get the same flawed, pointless study who funded this, and why?

ok. thanks for your reply.
johnson should be allowed in the debates if for no other reason than to set up a dynamic of two adults vs. one big fat baby.
more importantly: it sets up the dynamic of johnson as clinton's *true* opponent, leaving trump's third wheel in the dust.

but now mr birther is recanting- proving he will say anything. will his supporters notice or care about this major flip flop?
nope. and the perfidy of the news media is already baked in.
i wonder where donald jr 1st heard the reference "warming up the gas chamber" bc i see it often in tweets to me from trump supporters
what is worse, the holocaust reference itself or that he thinks that the gas chambers were warmed up.

don't feel bad for us. we chose to wade in this mess.
tip for my media friends: cover his press conference today and don't mention it was at his new hotel in dc. watch the infantile fury.
thought he doesn't care about his business. using campaign to promote. insane.
why? most voters are idiots and he knows he can run you around breathlessly reporting on every dump he takes.
you went further out on the limb last week, and now he's sawing it off behind you. that's the reason for this tweet.
maybe he hasn't insulted you directly, but that shouldn't let him off the hook. and in fact, he has attacked women.
you're right, he hasn't insulted me directly but his missteps r more due to his political incorrectness not insincerity.

once you have a clot, you take blood thinners - for life normally! pneumonia also kills a lot of people daily!
heart disease is the number 1 killer &amp; trump takes meds for it.
6 us states have already seen snow! are you ready??
no! never ready for snow. prius isn't so good driving in it. need 4w drive!

but c'mon charley it's friday and we need to gleefully speculate about takeover targets
ha. they could still be right. just saying.
honestly a pretty big fan of ottessa moshfegh's anger levels.
excellent writer's tip: get hostile.
finding great joy in watching this older woman with impeccable style on the subway judge this 20 something with a shredded denim jacket on
she literally took her shades off just to size her up.
i just spent too much on a harley quinn costume...

quick paced conversation about setting up a meet. fastest way to kill it? ask him for a face pic. now silence for 4 days.

sanders: i'll 'try to overcome my depression' if trump wins | getty
that new sports car you bought should help now shouldn't it ? fcuk that communism sh1t eh bern?
well, here's a hint. "medicaid isn't good enough, we need coverage from private, for-profit insurance companies!"
thanks for the "news" on health insurance from a non-profit associated with a giant insurance provider
im disappointed n i voted4 him&amp; felt that he just rolled over after rigged the election
i know that bsanders will hold hrc accountable everyday. we have the vote the greater good.
democrats don't think so, they can't understand intelligent speech. they only understand lying and cheating.
they want to believe a narrative so badly,it doesnt matter the words are empty-only that theyre said
because bernie hasn't done what he said he'd do, and the berniebots are continuing to trash hillary.
i am curious why you are not attacking gary johnson, the candidate youth say they will vote for?
shit to personal ... and feminine
it's as personal as you make it &amp; negative, i know tons of dude with it and they don't portray as feminine
hugs and thanks
thank you. have a great weekend :-)
really hope we don't have to put up with these guys at the . and here's why -&gt;
couldn't agree more. they seem to be having a good time but spoil it for others.

i love "lie to me too"...ahhh so happy you finally got to hear it.

call your publicist.
then call your mom, it's that kind of day.
at least it's friday!
then i got pulled over while texting my parents about the accident!!
wow liberals are insane and kinda creepy
you think that's insane &amp; creepy? man, what do you think of trump mocking the disabled and saying he'd date his daughter?
it's crazy cause last week before the jets played i needed a rb and he asked me if i wanted him and i said no it's ok 😩😩😩😩
omg!!! 😂😂😂😂 maybe better off. don't want to change the good karma right now.
how we getting out there?
lmaooooo , i don't mind driving but i don't have that much space
that is what we tell you guys, to not hurt feelings. 😜
that's hilarious !
democrats don't think so, they can't understand intelligent speech. they only understand lying and cheating.
psychologically,the tactics they're using are powerful. hillary is so debilitated she's only a prop
how we getting out there?
we gonna have to take a few cars
he said he don't see color or race either.
anyone can have straight hair. straight hair is all genetics. you can't appropriate genetics. fuck outta here.
dragging the press to your new hotel to update us on a mistruth you tell about the president...what's press's obligation here?
do your jobs and point out that he is lying might be a place to start.
trump talking up medicaid as a means of replacing some of obamacare. i can’t imagine his party embracing this.
the problem is you sam! you continue to divide america rather than solutions &amp; viable compromises.
traitors oo! the trump is needed for balance. apparently hilary has pneumonia! are there any talks of conceding?
balance? ha! u want a bigot for balance😂killing me dude!hillary ain't going nowhere! fyi not that i like that female.
so i think it's safe to say that walk off home run and the announcement of is the definition of a exceptional thursday.
also, i think it must be said that my next hat in my collection should be pink.
democrats don't think so, they can't understand intelligent speech. they only understand lying and cheating.
but it doesn't matter.make her look good when she is seen and have the right things said on tv &amp; sm
saw this and it strikes me as exactly the type of thing people are mad about when they say there's false equivalency
this type of vapid chatter is really confined to cable filling hours. lots of other media doing strong, critical coverage of born candidates
i'm totally happy to. the bernie brigade seems to disagree.
maybe, just maybe could try disdaining youth from voting gary johnson, the actual threat.
i'm so hesitant on tickets cuz idk if genbeauty is gonna be too much
i always pick one makeup showcase a year like i can't do imats and the makeup show its too much 😩

when you deny the legitimacy of the first black president, it does not look like an accident--only a dog whistle
i disagree that this is brilliant. she is showing her hand for debate. their campaign is a .
i don't think she'll do the debates
she's a corrupt liar. if you're so easily taken in by a slogan then you deserve her.
america doesn't deserve a traitor like trump who loves dictators &amp; lies habitually. politicususa

just the crowd ...
it seems that the smurfs might have a new slur for us? rad bulls/rad birds? i mean, ok, sure

the only way it isn't if it is due to aspiration and that means parkinsons. they are stuck.

you aren't a little upset about that one elderly woman who was mobbed at one of his rallies this week? typical of his events.

you can bet it wont be his blood.
people that wear open toed sandals/flip flops to the airport are a different breed of ew
where r u going?
"guarantees a whole lot of follow up" is pretty optimistic based on what we've seen the last few months
trump has has so much bad press, but i could see an argument for it being more shallow.
ok but like imagine having ur right foot in gakus ass and the other foot in yamatos so its like yamato and gaku are ur shoes and u walk,
i'm the person who has my foot shoved up gaku's ass
again? trouble for the congress in arunachal, 44 mlas led by pema khandu merge with the people's party

we need you to vote for hrc and hold her and your local elected officials accountable.

thank you 🤗
as med records aren't a matter of course for potus campaigns-who knows how many took blood thinners?

what is.....a pony roll
stop checking for me and worry about your mf self bitch!
lol obsessed ctfu its ridiculous how much u talk but never say shiy to chelse. bitch ur pathetic
and as a result of birtherism, 40% of trump supporters believe obama was not born in the u.s.
more likely as a result of bigotry and/or poor education
what's new on heinz field menu? franco's sausages, $15 fries, pork on pork sandwich

history: 9/11: 3,000 dead. iraq: 4,500+ dead, katrina fiasco, 2007 recession. trump advised by same conservative ideologues.
aww...wish i could,especially with paddles standing by 😁 sure you'll do great!👊🏻 up for a hike tho?

the not so veiled threat embedded in this section of brooks' column is chilling: "get in line or be hung out to dry"
i was hoping this was satire when i started it
it's disingenuous as is her entire campaign. mook is a bumbling idiot.
disingenuous are the clinton lives. it is her turn to be a used meat puppet
this lady just called to check in right now???? like check in is at 3 lady

imo larger european cage standards where chicken can move around spread wings etc is better then cage free.
my birds roam fields all day and go inside at night
to attack is to legitimize him. that's worse than clinton or trump to all the party leaders.
winning 26% of the youth vote has already legitimized gary johnson.

there is viable deal to be made if team wants to stay in oak - to much to say on - have shared views on radio/tv, may do so again.

terraforming mars is ages 12+, but i always think that, for smart "gamer kids", you can subtract 2 years.
i mean, trump *should* disavow it, of course. but it's not like all is instantly forgotten once he says the words.
whats trump expect obama to say "thanks"?
"i stand before you today to tell you, that blogger was wrong, dammit."
"i want to use 45 minutes of this hour to tell you exactly why. the last 15 minutes will be appropriative call and response."

donald trump on birther issue: "i'm going to make a big announcement on it today"
depending on how question is phrased is key: ask "do you really think trump's a bigot or is that a media invention" &amp; c what u get
: btw, your video ads automatically play, which it makes it impossible to start watch any articles you post with videos.
we do not allow those kinds of ads. do yo recall which ad it was on the blog?
he'll get credit for "putting the issue behind him." meanwhile will hillary even try to give a reason to be for her?
be for hillary because she's sure obama was born in the usa! usa has no other problems, so that's that!
reporters today covering trump don't forget to ask him why he questioned potus' admittance to harvard as well.
he said he is going to blame this on hrc today. said this on fox business this morning.
i bought a frozen pizza. good night.

trump campaign praises trump for forcing first black president to produce his birth certificate to prove he's legit

the protest ride you saw was this: too many 🚶‍♀️ &amp; 🚴‍♀️ deaths on our streets, too little action.
donald trump jr. on "gas chamber" remarks: "poor choice of words" but "i wasn't talking about the holocaust:"
like father like son!
how can you be so insensitive? police are shooting harambe's family down in the street and all you can think about is hurting joy

yes you should watch it. a milestone in the normalization of racism, xenophobia, hatred…
nope. it's not a huge deal but i use playlists to manage what i sync with each of my devices, so it's annoying.
wait just kidding it lost my whole library, not just playlists. i have it, but i need to reimport which is annoying on many levels.

says the man without 5 homeless shelters in one area 🤔🤔🤔
when another opened in my district this year, i supported despite some loud early voices of opposition.
no, didn’t “misstate key facts,” he straight out told bald faced lies about rev. faith green timmons,...
a disgrace on the pastors part! he was respectful and attacked nobody. you want to stay depressed vote dem.
have you looked at hillary lately?
i have seen her but i am not a doctor and wouldn't go to one who makes patently false ridiculous claims in writing
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
- you have done nothing but lie about all 6 months - you have nothing to run on, but lies for the gop !!!
yeah i cant wait!
me either.. looking forward to the tailgate.. i'm stoked.. n seeing a bunch of y'all is going to be great
we're looking for a house to rent in the winter n just found one thts $900 for a month rental this is gonna b a disaster
ooo, where, trying to do somethi g similar.
:( so long . you've been good to me.
lots of us use outlook here. it's a great app.
trump won't fully disavow his birther crap because too many of his followers really believe obama wasn't born in u.s.
i felt true shame that president obama felt the need to even react to this crap. i would've told them all to go to hell!
lmao why they on my dick lmfaoooo
they love you lmao
flint pastor: trump started to go beyond planned talking points
but if hillary had done that, she would have been freely allowed to speak. silencing a potus candidate is un-american!
yeah he should have made him open a pre-opened pickle jar instead.
sounds like it would fit in with trump's skill set
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
- try to defend the 105k slimey ass muslims that pres oslimey wants to bring in next month. bullshit - we can't afford them

trump's talking abt it b/c media is. loudmouth matthews using it to get ratings as he did w/abortion. media demeans the nation.

this just proves how confident he is, young mind, feeling good, great stamina, non-stop blue color candidate!
i agree. it's a challenge but there are a lot of educators actively working against that in their classrooms. that's hope.
absolutely - definitely need and continue to need people like you fighting the good fight 🙌🏽

you'd think most classrooms are churches with how much folks speak up in them. sure, no one wants to be the guy delaying class constantly...
but if the instructor asks a question- protip: you're supposed to speak up. share. "what is your air management policy? do you practice it?"
that's bullshit about teachers. my mother taught high school and proud union member. her students loved her.
instead of individuals i am talking about the system. finding the teacher who can change lives is rare. it shouldn't be.

if she doesn't do debates she loses election. it will be the final nail in her coffin.
i'm not sure i agree.remember,they only need plausible deniability.
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
- you cannot defend this shit any more. you have broken more laws than any other woman on earth !!!!
if you want to see what is wrong with media coverage of this campaign look at the wall to wall on trump's birther history.
trump will spin this as his campaign has already started to dump stuff on clinton. lies dragged behind lies. which leads me to a question ..
i didn't realize you had that low of an opinion about teachers.
i have a very high opinion of the power of the great teacher. it is a miracle how they can change lives.
we do not allow those kinds of ads. do yo recall which ad it was on the blog?
also do you recall if it was desktop or mobile?
oh i know i agree, i was just saying going forward as coquelin has become a liability.

if it's coming from a business, it's always "too good to be true" mike. short run vs long run.
yeah, you're right. was just thinking even with costing a little more, easing upgrade process would be worth it...
weird--why did barackobama sr. fail to list as his son in his 1961 ins application?
why does forget his youngest daughter in every speech?
father time remains undefeated. he has officially caught up with darrelle revis.
caught up last year. getting burned just confirms it. year with pats? ring and a shot knee.
if it's coming from a business, it's always "too good to be true" mike. short run vs long run.
but that doesn't appear to be the case

if she doesn't do debates she loses election. it will be the final nail in her coffin.
2 of 3 voting machines co.s are controlled by companies that support of clinton.didn't you see the email detailing it?
that's bullshit about teachers. my mother taught high school and proud union member. her students loved her.
a proud union member is just what every teacher should be. it's the system that stifles them. just like politicians.

hi twitter, i'm back! 🤓
- welcome back, we missed you!!! 😘😘
you want to understand the alt-right? read this. via
what's to understand? pres. obama made it clear with his "god, guns and gays" comment. how prescient.
i'll be back in ny october 15-18
oh my pre birthday? yassssssss
besides, kritter is still asleep and i am in a good mood.
we don't want to disturb the harmony then 😉
massive 21 minute speech by crooked hillary yesterday. outstanding! if went 30 minutes or less- msm would have a field day.
she is not well enough to do more.
yes black ppl, keep voting dem; stay stupid. enjoy the lies and ruined cities.
or you, the outright bigotry from the gop
no, the plan is to stop us from becoming a minority. you speak of it as if it were written in stone. but we can stop it.
ur an idiot. an idiot drowning in denial. rational white folks realize it ain't the end of the world. so enlighten me how are --
a downside of twitter is that i have a character limit and can't point out all the factually incorrect things here:
maybe donald trump is rich on money but the sad fool is poor on everything else his kids follow
same!!!!!!!!!! you coming to this?
of course its my last webster night before i move!
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
- there is no way that you can get away with all the laws you have broken and lying to american moms
i don't want to die so it would be nice if single payer were a thing

apple won’t even let me get in line until my reservation window opens. much different from last year.
they have your name on a very special list of people to keep waiting. i know a guy.
we need to stop rewarding ppl who want 2 multiply like rabbits. obama/dems reward being irresponsible. if u want 2 choose 2 multiply-u pay
agreed. sadly, been that way forever. the ones that need it have too much pride to take it while others milk the system.
oh noooo the next chainsmokers song is w/ chris martin?? god save us all!! 😷

hahaha that was my favorite part too
judge: "and who is representing the defense?" defendant: "i don't see how that's any of your business."
he looks younger and fitter than some 35yr olds i've seen 😁
if you have seen 35 year olds who look older and less fit than donald trump than they were in severe medical distress.

join me as i rewrite history. i will announce my new reality show, "whose lie is it anyway"?
agreed. although watching obama humiliate trump at correspondents dinner in 2011 was hilarious; makes it almost worth it
i agree. that was great. but, that's exactly the reason i would've told dump to go eff himself.

trump wants to ban muslims from the u.s. while hillary has been very busy bombing muslims in other countries. these are appalling options.
i dislike everything about hillary, but her trying to deal with the enemy. same with donald. he never said all, just enemies.

we need to release nonviolent drug offenders from prison and remove such offenses from their record so they're not locked out of society.

such irrelevant news , cnn has really gone in the tank
watch: lets jimmy fallon mess up his hair on late night tv.
there was nothing funny about that. trump is a white nationalist and fallon is giving him a platform.
if trump actually renounces birtherism today, the better question is why have you been lying about it for six years?

trump reigniting birtherism after both conway and giuliani tried to bury it for him just shows how cunning he is. or something.

demand -&gt; higher prices, higher prices -&gt; weaker demand??? that is economic loop-di-loop.
i wouldn't confuse rent &amp; healthcare price rise w/demand push. supply imbalances and 3rd party payor issues, respectively.

one thing that distinguishes mode media from other silicon valley failures is that people are not pretending to grieve for mode.
well, they owe us all money.
if trump is about to do what i think he's about to do, i think it's going to backfire on him quite badly.
if his story is "hillary invented birtherism and i'm the one who debunked it," that's an obvious lie, not unusual for trump. but.
i'll go out of my way to get away from whatever i'm doing just so i can tap out a rhythm pattern or something

it's not a lie about the terms of some business deal. it's about what he's done in our faces for years, what made him politically prominent.

it's not a lie about the terms of some business deal. it's about what he's done in our faces for years, what made him politically prominent.

to borrow a phrase from a prominent man, "how stupid are the people of this country?" he's finally underestimating the public intelligence.

i don't understand how trump's campaign isn't in the trash can with everything he says and does.

he learned that from the clintons

: says trump owes obama, americans apology over birther claims
hold on! her camp started the birther claims in 2008. this is bullshit
in ’s defense, i’m lately getting _super_ confused by packages where it’s not clear if it’s official or not.
it's almost as if established trademark law had a purpose to it...

i'm so sorry.
have you ever realized your outfit was a mistake less than an hour after you got to work and then you just had to deal with it all day

how not? he needed to adjust, get them help, make a change in fly. good coaches do that
there's only so much you can do from the sidelines. he can't make these guys turn and look at the ball
i hope it is that hillary is dropping out!
we can only hope but it's mainly about birther issue.

you obviously missed the episode where fallon pressed xi jinping on his south china sea policies
birtherism was never misunderstanding. it was tool trump used to build his rep with white supremacists via
was he really that strategic about it back then?
easy way out would be to make one in python
i put a significant python system into production at a prev job, so that would be cheating.
a pass? my thread is littered w/stupid threats because pushing on trump for playing with such an ugly topic

a word about anti-blackness &amp; school law enforcement. the term "police state" is redundant; you have no indissoluble rights, period.
the "rule of law" is pure ideological abstraction from ownership. even schools embody a physical fight for who owns the law and who obeys.
donald trump looks at women and decides how their looks rate on a scale of one to 10.
just like all other men
pretty sure soundcloud notified me about a 2nd side remix from an artist i don’t follow

that fits the conventional narrative around conservation, but the existing plans are hardly a "dream verdict" for industry.
conventional narrative, in this case, equals reality. constant chipping away at sage grouse conservation is the strategy.

dragging the press to your new hotel to update us on a mistruth you tell about the president...what's press's obligation here?
call him out as a liar, manipulator and huckster. you are losing your street cred
...suspended or expelled for behaving how anyone would given their conditions it is remiss to criminalize them. try to imagine police ...
...wrestling wealthy white males in business suits to the ground, pointing guns into their shiny bmws,shooting them to death at will...
purely coincidence. purely.
and media is saying, why now? good thing i have a nice stack of magazines on the coffee table to hurl a the tv.

if "not warranted" decision keeps stakeholders at the table, includes strong grouse plans &amp; avoids esa backlash, that's a win
i think this "esa backlash" concern that seems so in fashion among conservationists is a major strategic error.
how many iphones have you ever owned
7: 3gs, 4s, 5s, 6, replacement 6 for broken mute switch, 6s+, 7+.
not risking embarrassment is more important than dismantling privilege, &amp; erasing evidence of wrongdoing is easier than a sincere apology.
learning to apologize is important not only because you can then stay in the space and be a true ally (and...isn't that what you want?)--
i don't believe dena ever took a leave of absence. she came back to stop whatever she didn't approve of.
dena's so called leave of absence was in august, meaning 6 months of reboot was her writing. now she's trying to shirk responsibility.
i'd love to attend as i am a big fan

donald trump is unfit to be president. we just can’t accept this. we’ve got to stand up to this. if we don’t, it won’t stop.
you are not fit because of your health
thanks lol and usually in torched for my psychotic takes on twitter
we've all been there. this team has a way of doing that to a guy. they should make prozacs with little buffalos on them

then being exonerated...day after day. you can't, it's unthinkable.daily reality for black youth is literally unimaginable to white folks...
...in the paradigm in which hoodies are red herrings to homogenize black bodies with criminality but white hoods and badges aren't.
it does, fuckwad. when someone lies you should tell your readers.
i read the article to ultimately come out agreeing with you.
learning to apologize is important not only because you can then stay in the space and be a true ally (and...isn't that what you want?)--
and also, because if you stick around, you learn from your gaffe. why is that important? because if, not you'll gaffe again.
work from home also exists, she expect us to believe she didnt skype in lol
lol. she is clearly delusional. unprofessional too, blaming her fellow writer and thinking she alone knows what's good.
just yesterday, trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the united states.

i know what trending is. i was referring to facebook, which is america's most widely read news source.
yeah, just don’t think it’s fair for journos to keep equating trending’s influence to the news feed.
six weeks in and the enormity of the end of a relationship and moving home is hitting hard for the first time.
ugh, i'm sorry. that is such a shitty time.

personally i might upgrade, my expectation was low to begin and think they surpassed it
if trump owns it he will likely try to cast himself as helping country resolve a real issue.
he already did this in his campaign statement - it's an absolute outrage! i sure hope this energizes hrc's base to vote.
i’m ok with that, too. but my list doesn’t start with russ.
i kind of agree. i just rather get rid of anyone associated with putting together any roster from 2000-2014
perhaps calling black youth "super predators" wasn't a great idea.
no it wasnt !!!! hoping the black community's have realized clinton will do nothing for you but take your vote :(
and also, because if you stick around, you learn from your gaffe. why is that important? because if, not you'll gaffe again.
when you gaffe again, you alienate more people. receipts pile up. if not on twitter, irl. rumors spread. word gets around.
trump didn't start , it was michelle. trump just took her word. she can't be wrong...or is she racist?
but, but, he is the president, his home country could not be kenya. she mis-spoke, yea right.
i'm noticing now that i can go long periods of time without the tv on, which prior would be on as long as i was home either stream or cable
not that i paid attention to it the entire time - i certainly couldn't but there used to be something about the constant noise that i needed
no. definitely not overrated. top-6 in three straight years despite topping 140 tgts once. one injury.
but how far off was he from julio/ab/obj in points? i have to look more into it. but i doubt it's close

digby likes to address sadness with face licks, which is nice in theory but also kinda gross
i cannot contain my feelings about this. you can't be down looking at that face.
feels like it's just too soon for a movie about that disaster
are you talking about america or deepwater horizon?
our road is blocked. this truck is trying to drop off product. actual disaster. this business is forsaken by god
clearly the gods are telling you to relocate may i recommend lovely hillside, coincidentally the next town over from me

hillary clinton: “barack obama was born in america... and donald trump owes him and the american people an apology.”

i see you've basically answered my question already. sorry about that one.
it's okay it's a good question. i actually was called out a few months ago and kindly educated. i left it up as a record.
trump needs these 3 things to win over black voters:
why even publish this garbage article?

good question i have wondered about this too
it's okay it's a good question. i actually was called out a few months ago and kindly educated. i left it up as a record.
i struggled with that because i fear the statement is harmful, but ultimately i want to own my harm.
awkwardly tweeted this morning about how i wanted jimmy fallon to run for president before i heard/saw his little bit with trump.
so naturally i immediately deleted the tweet and now i have some feelings and y not get them out, so hi twitter.
i hate it when hotels have body wash instead of bars of soap.
bars of soap are for the olds. and super wasteful since you'd never use a whole one and then they are thrown out.

yeah. i'm not sure though. how about monday night. they might give us our checks early
what is this!!!! explain right now 😤
you play with him?
we sure can!
i'm serious. i know you're a trip planning goddess.
the presence of love &amp; hard work doesn't prevent total failure as a result. do people delegitimize the term w/overuse? yeah.
one person's opinion of an interpretable piece of expression doesn't define it for everyone.
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
how many times does he have to say they are being audited.

why are there so many species of bugs, but so few species of human?
because humans destroy each other and can't live in harmony like bugs can. more human species will destroy the planet faster
i thinks he's worse than that. trump makes george w look statesman like in comparison.

since the move to 1.0.0, ive needed to add `--repo-update` to `pod install` every time ive run it 😑
depending on what you’re doing then, you may want to use `pod update [pod_name]` instead?
trump has shown again and again that what he aims for is attention--for whatever. almost doesn't matter why. today is a good example.
let him keep on inflating as it will lead to something big ....

yea, a large part of the population completely agrees with him... the worst dual standard in reporting i've seen in 60 years

and that really hurt.

the polls are closer than ever, and the stakes couldn't be higher. chip in today.

maybe a better temperament because she would be unconscious most of the time from passing out

lies are deplorable
pass it on! is unamerican-be patriotic &amp; vote for pro american
this statement from the trump campaign on obama's american roots is pathetic, demeaning and shameful. screw them.

the school is lying saying that they left school "on their own accord." they know damn well they sent them back home.

also i thought that form was the "oops we screwed up, let us know what you'll be looking for so we can manage stock for upgrade program"

this does absolutely nothing to his supporters who feel like hillary is just as bad as, if not worse than, trump.
anyone who feels that way is... not with it. at all.
i was smirking and birdman rubbing my hands together after the first paragraph knowing it would be good.

honestly i don't watch him anyway but if you do this might be a good reason to stop.
i just turned my tv on &amp; it was on cnn, red assure its not anymore

they'll "report the story" josh.

i'd be more on board with libertarians if they started by attacking the military-intelligence-industrial complex, instead of, say, education
liberals are already doing the latter for them anyways via privatization

bernie sanders on trump's claim that he we get bernie supporters: "please, do not — anybody — confuse trump with me"
no we wont-you purchase a third house-that's how socialism works for leaders-not the peasants
.: "[trump] is feeding into the worst impulses: the bigotry and bias that lurks in our country."
so speaks the bigot!
trump jr. in 2014 praised his dad's "moral conviction" on obama birtherism
nice that u praise daddy 4 his racist agenda-he trys to invalidate our 1st black pres -moral conviction my ass!

she's a lying pos just like the rest of them disgusting family
it took me 5 minutes to find the bathroom but it's fine cause i guarantee my prof is still ranting on hillary

trump tells too much truth? now this will be a problem btwn us, going forward. how can you say this man "tells too much truth"?
he is gloriously honest to a fault. look at how dirty colin powell talked in secret, trump will say it in the open. just true
i cry every day

no, it hurts me that hillary recently stated she was against gay rights. that's what hurts me. you like it?
1) not that recent, 2) the republican platform is against gay marriage and trump's vp is most anti-lgbt pol in us
has he released his emails? if he did, you know he'd have much worse things than powell. you know that, right? he'll be full 1/
he doesn't do email, never believed in it. everything u need to know about him is in public. he speaks his mind everyday
she means mine, because we're married she gets to claim it partially.
oh! i didn't know you were married! huzzah!!
had a dream i was at denny's with and i said i love denco's and somehow won a huge flat screen tv for saying that. honestly wth?
congratulations tho
for info, i was "doored" off my bike. didn't even see it, must have hit the front of the bike. lucky in many ways, and helped by many too.
at least you live in a country where cycling is dangerous enough to wear a helmet!
moving cap tables and private portfolio management to the cloud is super powerful:
often, a cap table is more of a 'guideline', where access to that information is fiercely protected and frankly even obfuscated.
islam is no more violent than christianity, and christians have committed more terrorist acts than muslims
yes: crusades as an example. actually both are very similar if you look past 'naming' the creator.
cannot wait to go!!! go ahead have 1 more, i won't tell! lol. were they big or mini?
haha. i like how you think! the cannolis were the perfect size. and best part. the choco chips in the filling.

omg i know! remind me which one this was?
i think his name is alex? really annoying voice black glasses
i'd like to take this moment to point out that is the only candidate that doesn't travel with his press corps. the only 1.
trump understands the press is not there to help him,but to purposely make him look bad. so better off not having the propool

islam is no more violent than christianity, and christians have committed more terrorist acts than muslims
it's the fanaticism that sheds poor light on all religion. practicing for oneself rather than others is key.
haha come pick me up ;)

thanks for your support of public lands!
have had my senior pass for some time now. nationalparks are a must to visit.our heritage
it's not the price. you could price it for 50$ and they still lied about being an online game.
price played into it , indie game for 60 is setting expectations too high for that studio
it's a beautiful theory! it'd be awesome if it were true.
i liked the, like, vague feminism of it. can man science explain breasts?????
mostly the same people, is all i am saying.

happy friday denise i see you are a comedian where can i see some of your work i can use some laughing therapy in my life
remember, dena bragged up the necktie storyline saying it will go on for a while just like she is now with the criminals.
dena loves to use storylines to get ratings then she lets it all go to crap again once they have a renewal. returns will leave again.
respect here is a idea of that: try to listen when you can &amp; get back to me.peace
. i will take a listen
trump tells fbn i was "very rude" to ivanka and "really attacked" her "viciously" and calls me "non intelligent"

let's be very clear here. trump is the enemy. donald and his greedy family will never be president
trump is literally running for president as a giant marketing campaign for his ego and properties. and many conservatives are defending it!
he will put assets into "blind trust" kids running people believe it would be blind . dear leader says it so true

1) there is no 28...missing 57 so i assume it's him. 2) 48 should stay with 19-8, best line in hockey in 2nd half

donald trump calls reporter who grilled ivanka “non-intelligent”
is that a word?
who cares about trump campaign, we want to see him say it . he's a racist lying con man
sadly still more honest than former lady secretary
going out this weekend? we’ve got you covered. here’s a code from bud for a ride home.

i find it weird how far along the cgi is. i mean it's practically done. wonder why they canned it
donald trump was the birther-in-chief. he is still the birther-in-chief.
correction: and are.
but the point that density is achievable without high rises is very important and small devs need to be allowed.
just saying it's not some newfangled thing &amp; 2x is trivial. paris is also 14x as dense as boulder w/o high rises.
truly amazed that w/additional days 2 think &amp; plan, hillary is still one-note johnna. is that all she's got? "go to her website for issues"?
that's all she has
nothing to see here. it's just another paid supporter.
proped up by media
any journalist who covers trump's racist birtherism as he said/she said story should resign immediately. no time for false equivalence
maybe the press should just boycott an announcement from him for a change. just not cover his ass for a chng
we love this slide from showing the aging populations across the globe.
what's with the stereotype icons? all japanese work in rice paddies and all americans are cowboys?
personally i think that's stupid af then!! i love when openers are actually killin it and doin good
an opener will never get a gig again if he tries to go harder than the opener..
trump says he'll make a "major statement" on obama birther issue today:
anything for a photo-op
maybe it has something to do with the color of my skin.
the color of your skin makes up one of millions of characteristics that make humans beings complex.

again, rumor not proven to come from clinton or her campaign. also see
so if you say, rumor not proven, why bother arguing it? are you privy to some information the rest of america isn't?
i'm not a crazy person so didn't flip out... but what now? they took my name and number and said they'd call me.
troubling. harkening back to the early days of iphone but this is worse because expectations were explicitly set and missed.
this is why fell below msnbc. network of bathhouse club members it is

in weird way it's beneficial that racist people share on a public platform if the job goes to equally qualified non racist person
ideally they wouldn't be so narrow minded... but at least they are publicly documenting their stupidity for all to see.

i had no idea there was a tag this is pretty neat
maybe there wasn't an actual but it was a trending topic and you dominated.
hm, that is really interesting. it very few people who actually hates music itself, so he rarely listen to music?
just disinterested in mainstream music. perhaps he likes classical but nothing under modern label control anyways
when i saw wanted to say: "you are the coolest, i have an overwhelming urge to hug u" played it cool: "ur talk was really good"

trump was 63 minutes late to his own press conference.
but those were good minutes. let me tell you how good they were: you have no idea.
don't ever say "well it can't get any worse"

appreciation day for this beautiful girl!💗😘

oh look! and some major free press for his new hotel. lol please! 🙅🏾
i must've missed this one but who is opening a new hotel.... you're too funny girl
if trump holds conference abt pbo bc &amp; blames hrc &amp; press stays silent they have abdicated their responsibility as press in a democracy 1/2
and are nothing more than stenographers for propaganda no different than pravda under ussr
maybe trump will actually announce that he is dissolving the massive conflict of interest that is the trump organization
except there isn't one... there's a live feed. blahaha!
there was a antitrust suit in the eyeglass industry in 1940. fdr broke the power of eyeglass companies to gouge.

. "i think this was a self-inflicted wound by ."
- just a bump in the road , lets talk about the ambassadorships sold by hillary when she was at the state dept. !!!
. on media narratives-"when the public sees trump as more honest than clinton something has gone wrong."
in your warped word. we, the people, live in reality!
while a tv fool promotes his dc hotel, a real president is at work.
with republicans.
the trump is using this event to promote his new hotel. unbelievable
how much is he paying himself?
hope you don't have anywhere else to be today.
i had mine shipped. out for delivery today. without the painful lines.
another conspiracy theory. as usual you provide no concrete evidence!
. here's proof. trump converted $5k in donations to charity into $5k in free advertising for his business.
. says medal of honor winners 'have a lot more courage than i do."
and of must made them feel so special.
nice trade. where are you the weakest?
i've got sammy watkins so that could weaken my wr depth and flexing is an issue. got obj, watkins, hogan, floyd, &amp; marty bennett

really? we're waiting for a breaking news announcement that trump believes the president of the united states is an american citizen!?
the sad part is that he got 4 or 5 stupid assed black mother f@&amp;$ers to stand by him while he did that crap
these people as president and first lady?😖 repugs are ridiculous!
so tacky and classless.

i wonder how many contractors/suppliers he has stiffed for their services upon completion of this new tacky trump hotel
yeah i back like cook crack
you're still in va right?
. "i think this was a self-inflicted wound by ."

lol you crack me up. a victim!?! i see you. you want the normalisation of racism because if successful it keeps your status
quo in tact. i didn’t even get into the fact that is a large part of the population who would be affected by the racism but
this weekend will be overwhelming. it’s ok to take a step back. it’s ok to breathe. (and, fyi, i brought chocolate if you need it).
chocolate?!?! yasss!!
for early risers.... ..... study hall awaits.
he was a fm for 2 days, w/ his twin.
so we can all agree that obama's birthplace &amp; eligibility to run for potus was questionable?
"patriots" w/so little faith in america to think not properly vetted.
everybody had an opinion on the durant move but i didn't hear a peep about this lil "can you hear me now" verizon dude sprint flip flop
can’t believe his original contract didnt have a non compete in it
can you send me the number that called you as well as the number they told you to call them back at?
i went to the irs web site. the call back numbers the scammers leave all vary
not one of his 13,001 republican opponents called him out for it.
not a single shameless deplorable one
if he really felt different he would have personally apologized 2 bo &amp; then to americans
. trump only looks up to putin.

thx marie! look forward to staying in touch virtually over the next few days..

you two are hilarious!
we just don't want you to get a swell head now that you are a big fancy nba star
looking good on the shelves of maruzen!
woot! is that a belly band around the bottom out the real cover?
no way in hell this birtherism charade would be treated with so much nihilistic glee if most newsrooms weren't white as the driven snow
ain't that the truth
1. trump's campaign claims he was convinced obama was a u.s. citizen beginning in april 2011. this is a lie.
i put a bunch of his birther tweets into a moment:
quo in tact. i didn’t even get into the fact that is a large part of the population who would be affected by the racism but
you wouldn’t care. that’s the crux of this.
love how basic commons like this still show the flavor of kaladesh as an anthropocene world

did this really happen lol
this is the 2nd time something like this happened. i'm still stepped to the side.

i dig so hard. (not even a minor)
even if this tweet was true about clinton campaign in 2008 – which it is not – this would be bs false equivalency.
exhaustive fact check on it:
so who do u think played the best game??
of the f3 no question its paul.
trump honoring medal of honor recipients, veterans,&amp; a gold star family at dc event.so far no comment birther issue
is that what he's doing? honoring them? or shamelessly hiding behind a "patriotic" wall to promote his hotel? i'm disgusted.
has trump pulled a bait and switch on the cable nets? teased a big birther announcement. then puts up vets who praise him.
and the media fell for it hook line and sinker. they are his biggest source of support by far. it is a disgrace.
i support this decision.
because you are an exceptional human being 🙂
just seem this guy in witch wood!! lol
oh no! i'm happy you escaped! he's a monster of a man ;)
i'm a little concerned for your mental well-being if he wins. no matter who wins, we're all going to wake up nov 9th and go to work
yes, just like when hitler won in germany. nothing really changed.
it's pay day bitches!
can i borrow sum money
now trump getting free airtime for vets ad -- amazing how he games the cable and network people -- by saying he's making 'big announcement'
when will the press get tired of being played??
raputre! columbia is a racist hell hole.
you need the hashtag
donald trump speaking live from his hotel in dc. he is expected to address the birther issue
the non issue some lowbrow folks had an issue with as ducky threw it out there to measure the level of potential support for a prez run

guano apes - lord of the gourds
doesn't matter where he was born, only that he has never once sided with american citizens. get off the birther kick. we don't care
and that he ushered in regressive policies and almost every point.
your fave even admitted i didn't do it leave me alone about it
and for those of y'all thinking those are my receipts i wasn't even here when shit happened so leave me alone
silly boy it's his jacket! 😂😂

the only difference between trump and kim jong un is that we have no proof that trump has had anyone killed.
but!! there's still attention payed to the overshadowed natural world
it just loves artifacts too guys!
. "i think this was a self-inflicted wound by ."
- so, tell me how the hell you defend wanting to bring in 105,000 fucking savages !!! fuck no. behead,mom holds her
seems obvious the reference was to prison/ punishment/execution gas chambers, not genocide.
then he should have used electric chair or hanging. both more popular forms of execution in the united states
wow, perfect illusion is freefalling everywhere. world is very sad place rn. hope trump can restore it but am afraid it's 2 late for godga
you know godga is huge supporter of clinton, right?
at a complete loss to imagine who would want to stand behind trump for the big birther speech. who are these men?
the folk wearing the blue ribbon are medal of honor winners.
it's specifically provided for in the 1st amendment!!!
what tweet of dan's does this pertain to?
and george w. bush would be a fairy-filled walk in the park compared to trump. there’s just no conceiving.
this set of tweets is what terrifies me. and also why i now appreciate how upset my parents were about reagan.
and large number of those "100-138%" are at 100% almost exactly. fancy that.
we know this how?
to my 1976 eyes, the most striking part of logan's run was jenny agutter. viewed in 2016 it's the subtext of white supremacy.

this needs to be a cult
so why is the media not exposing him and inform the voters not to make a fatal mistake to vote trump?
so why is the media not exposing him. the media just gave you that.

girl, i have a rule that brandon has to come to target with me during the fall or i will buy everything!
hahahaha girl my struggle is same
the only reason trump is "overweight" and not "obese" is that he now claims to be 6,3 when before his height was always listed as 6,2
during the gop primaries he was 6' !".
i am so angry at what he is doing right now. parading all these military men who are putting obama down
these men are sexist

it's for the greater good.

remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.

twitter polls
the (correct) reasoning is that he is legitimizing racism misogyny homophobia, etc by even inviting this guy onto his show
trumps done rounds of all major comedy shows(incl. snl)in past decade.what fallon did is no diff frm what's already been happ
tt the whole season, no matter what happens
fair enough. the guy has to improve quickly though, still doesn't see the middle of the field. his ol gave him all day

pres. obama 'shocked' at birther issue: "i was pretty confident about where i was born."
guess he never spoke to his grandmother who said he was born in kenya. democrats are good at creating false documents.
i won't deny, it is a funny front page.
how can they get away with putting that picture of her though? lmao they aged her by 2 decades
the understanding was that trump's event would be a presser. but media sitting six rows back, in roped off area. very hard to ask questions.
then idk, leave? should we feel bad for you? you all know the definition of insanity, yeah?

hrc has been consistently dishonest since being kicked of watergate team,it's fun watching left panic now that polls shifted

we get the world we deserve. we get the world we made. ahora chupate eso por cuatro años.
trump would stay longer, but he's got hotels to open in brockway, ogdenville and north haverbrook.
in any case, i'm looking forward to jimmy fallon's "lip-synch battles" with putin and kim jong-un during november sweeps.
barack obama was born in america, plain and simple. donald trump owes him and the american people an apology.

seen bernie stump for dems a few times in last week -- his most common anti-trump case is that "he believes climate change is a hoax."
his passion and enthusiastic support of hrc is inspiring. said no one.
talked to one of the managers of apple union square. you can preorder the iphone then bring it to the store to get into the upgrade program.
manager also said they release in store pickup inventory at 8am every day.
watching tv through the twitter app on apple tv was actually quite an amazing experience. they did a very good job with it.
... had no idea. what's the programming? videos posted to twitter? i'll try it out. one of those plays i never saw coming

do any of the jurors appear to be actively taking notes throughout this trial in general?
none. they are all listening. and they seem, for the most part, to be paying attention. it got boring a couple days ago
meaningful conversations on twitter are responses to tweets. not just a like or retweeet. aka y’all better respond to my tweets!! 😝
responding! so glad you are here!!
the uses of patriotism, via disgusting i couldn't read past counterproductive!!

anyone see if the specs on the new iphone 7’s wi-fi chipset is mu-mimo capable?
it might be any way i can test it with a r710?

how many times does trump have to scream at his rallies about how much he hates the press before the press believes him?
i think the press thinks that as long as he talks about them it's good for them. they're just like him.
it's darker in person. it's so nice. better than the jet black. i'm getting mine next weekend

obama lost white voters by 20% to romney, yet his winning popular vote was majority white.

that i find a little disrespectful, having family and friends fighting and dying for america. but that's just my opinion

now you know how we feel when brit writers have american characters call it "hospital" instead of "the hospital."
well we americans call soleless demons "gingers" now, so there is some cross pollination
the american experiment is over.

this isn’t over for me.
trump lied when he said hrc started birtherism in 2008. she may have been soft on it then, but an illinois man started it in 2004.

watch hillary speak live at the black women's agenda symposium:
i don't think so. hillary is nothing but a complete idiot who sold america to the highest bidder
welcome to the winning team
i'm not ready for this accountability
that's it?!! what a fucking fraud. and trump walks away from the mic, claiming to having finished the birther issue? what an asshole.
&amp;michael flynn takes over the mic as trump ignores ?s from reporters&amp;they shut down the event. must ask abt this on 9/26.
i hope you can get the deal 💚💙 i'm sure you'll have the larries' support cause we all live this 😂
that's great to hear - we want your support!

donald trump: "president barack obama was born in the united states. period."
wow, thanks for clearing that up, dt!
so what’s everyone thinking for lunch?
go! go! curry
it’s absolutely insane that donald trump is acting like being a birther was actually him being nice and helpful to obama. how.
it's bizarro world - it's orwell defined
donald trump just got cable news to air 25 minutes of veterans praising him
and this...isn't new. don't headline it like they didn't know what they were getting into.
i'm so in love with it i wrote them a love letter
arielle!! 💖💖💖 i'm going to cry on this letter.

well not everyone does black all year round like you 🙄
maybe they should, that's all i'm sayin 😌
trump is now taking cameras with him on a tour of the hotel. unbelievable.
trump needs to be sent to prison for hate speech.
to be fair i think they stopped doing that when enough people complained. but they were super reluctant to do it at first
we worked with them and github archive to set standards for privacy. they were happy to follow our guidance.
the uses of patriotism, via disgusting i couldn't read past counterproductive!!
white guys love telling us dark people what we should do it and how we should do it and create our narrative for us foh

'barack obama was born in the united states. look at the gold toilets in my hotel. these are fantastic gold toilets.'
trump should be fined $6 million for hate speech.

we had a clinton and a bush in this election...we let them choose dynasties for us like this is a parliament.
these tweets about this trump event are hilarious. the media let itself get played over and over and this is like a capper.
that these reporters were up for treating trump supposedly repudiating birtherism like meaningful news should embarrass them all
i would love to do all of the gem social media when this reunion happens! xx 🙏🏼❤️

president obama’s successor cannot and will not be the man who led the racist birther movement. period.
this is about the fifth time you have mentioned this. i don't even think was born here
i think it's closer to 12 blocks but point taken
you be my eye in the sky; i'll be at ground zero!
yes, i would like an answer to this myself!
does any1 care about this? maybe u all need 2 go this way!
only civilized america vomited, trump supporters are cheering
so now they'll change their beliefs because the grand poo bah *lies* and says it's so? deplorable.

birther: trump event goes on live cable tv for over 20 minutes and then says, very briefly, that obama was born in the usa
i want obama to call bruce and approve the use of "born in the usa" at every appearance he does for hillary.
what did i miss
they just showed 20 mins of trump being praised because he said he'd address the birther issue.
accidentally got into a welfare debate with my friend and he stopped responding so i think i pissed him off
it's much easier dealing with friends who yell instead of giving the silent treatment.
the human toll of the philippines’ war on drugs
killing all drug dealers will save millions of lives and families. bravo for taking a stand!
trump just aired free 30 min endorsement from veterans at his new hotel to falsely say clinton started his conspiracy theory about president
no. the press did. you all allowed him to do exactly what you knew he would do.
looking forward to your challenge
right? this feels very up our alley re and precision public health
is that even possible?? 😂
😂😂 i don't plan on trying to find out!
he was talking about jhene aiko, now that's everyone's girl 😂
bino hit it first 😂
coming from the woman who used laugh while brutally humiliating women with "curves" (biggest loser), this is rich

trump doubled down on lie-filled statement from his campaign last night &amp; took no responsibility for his bigoted attacks on our president
i am so angry that he came out right now for 10 words and blamed it on hrc
i actually think this might have been the final straw for many in the media - they're tired of being played for fools by trump.
one can wish.

it's the truth — news organizations have a responsibility to work smarter. trump is wily but a known entity
why is this rambling trump event being cover in total? this is what ppl are talking abt. this is not "earned" media bc it's not newsworthy…
i am so angry at him right now.
trump: hillary clinton campaign started "birther issue... and i finished it."
please don't give trump air time. he made a fool of the media
hillary started the birther issue but trump finished it: obama you are officially born in america, congratulations.
fuck trump and his bs,,,you are all scumbags
i am now going to the brand new trump international, hotel d.c. for a major statement.
just do what you
damn, that's the realest thing i've ever heard.

that hillary started the rumors. the journalists are all pissed off, i’m pissed off…i hate trump so much.
donald trump: "president barack obama was born in the united states. period."
this is just a circus. so trump is announcing what everyone has known forever? this is what the media calls news?
i'm just suggesting there are other ways or days they could have done it. maybe a week of all black or something?
i can see that as well, because it can be easily misinterpreted on america day.
any reading you could recommend me about game design? :)
a book of lenses is pretty great reading for designers looking to improve their game.

i prefer to think of it as a slutty co-ed fraternity
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
you started the birthed movement in 2008 lest you forget.
new clinton campaign video: "birther"
she is only trying to win back her base. we need to start spelling desperate with an -hrc
to the average voter, this will make media questions about trump's "past birtherism" look hysterical and pointless.
trump is a hate monger who belongs in prison for his hate speech.
as of now we are closed due to the weather. will update if we decide to open!

today, the breaking news is that gop presidential nominee has decided that our first african american president is a legitimate president.
how does his base take this? because they do not agree.
this is where we're at as a country: it's news when a presidential candidate admits the president of the us is american.
donald trump is a national disgrace. this election is beyond embarrassing.

i actually think this might have been the final straw for many in the media - they're tired of being played for fools by trump.
i hope you're right about that. that was my first instinct too. but then i came back to... nah, it will keep happening.
donald trump still refuses to say was born in america. and this man wants to be our president? when will he stop this ugliness?
how many times are you going to run with this. it is stupid o your part. obama is a jerk and stupid

he got half an hour of free tv time. what the actual hell. media are pissed off that he rickrolled them.
i have notifications enabled for actual breaking news, aka "hey the entire world is on fire", not this crap.
if journalists actually acted like journalists, trump wouldn't even be in this position. this election is a macabre circus

now trump appears to be refusing to acknowledge reporters’ questions at what he billed as a _news_ conference.
it's not a "news conference," it's the aristocrats!

um, i learnt basic programming at school 20+ years ago and now my 11-yo has started as a matter of course. it's not rocket surgery.
. um, i can program the full stack. ease (or lack thereof) has nothing to do with whether or not it is a useful endeavor for people
speaker gift at was to have a star named after me. great idea tho i feel bad for the star having such a boring german name.
shout out to the team for such a thoughtful and on-point gift!
trump said he believes obama was born in us but didn't explain why he changed his mind. has been no new evidence since '11 birth certificate
his campaign made him say it.
he also sprinkled it with puritan history.. really!!! sociopaths
these guys don't matter

watch msnbc in 2011: saying hillary clinton started the birther movement.
good news. you no longer have to defend trump's birther idiocy. you can stop blaming clinton for trump's five years of bigotry
your push notif abt "please refrigerate or consume the food upon arrival" when an order is accepted seems really weird cc
is that some kind of lawyer-imposed thing that you're required to do?
hillary’s live at . tune in to hear about her vision for an inclusive america.
why as you are adopting all of obama failing should have never endorsed obama as he is a fail

email rendering - specifically text size in certain emails - regressed in ios 10. many emails displaying a font that's unreadably small.

there is no violence at hillary's rallies. all the violence is at trump's rallies and trump is a violent sick man that needs help
" there is no violence at hillary's rallies." because trump supporters for the most part don't take part in it. end of story
even cool dog?
somebody worked hard to make him the coolest dog of all... and somewhere (presumably) someone likes it.
do majority of americans want the next president talking about old birtherism or current threats from enemies abroad? you know the answer

i will now tell you a story about why it is not always a good idea to send someone a book for blurbing without asking them first.
1. someone sent a book to my nyc address without contacting me/my editor/my agent first so i have no idea to keep an eye out for it
this is a breaking news item in 2016. what a great election!
no questions taken from press, 1 line, that's it, &amp; he lied when he said hrc started it. it originated in 2004 in illinois

in '08 whan hillary supporters claimed that obama wasn't born in america, why didn't she call her supporters a basket of deplorables???
maybe it was because the only ones who did so were fringe supporters who did so after she endorsed obama.

i think grubman is coming to tell oakland it's now or never. city has had years and years to assemble a plan. nada.
😂😂😂😂 you're a fool if you believe that
hillary clinton did not start birtherism. that's an outright falsehood. this was an unfounded right wing conspiracy theory.
but what happened to the bs 'investigators' who found things "we would not believe"?

if trump loses it's his fault.if clinton loses it's her fault. partisans quit whining about the media, &amp; hold your own candidate accountable

you do resemble that remark
1. someone sent a book to my nyc address without contacting me/my editor/my agent first so i have no idea to keep an eye out for it
2. i just picked up mail after 3 months so it's been sitting there this whole time gathering dust and now it is impossibly short deadline
it's a graveyard in here, folks. won't anyone make a stapler that can survive a college…
can you help us? make a stapler that will hold up to college students!
well that was a clusterfuck for the trump campaign
sure, but he'll probably gain a point in florida because hillary coughed.
how will they come back as a luxury?
people still love and will love human touch, originality; these products will be a luxury as digital economy is destroying em
the birther movement started by a anonymous email from a clinton supporter. (oops i think i know a anonymous person who is good with emails)
that did not start a movement. don't you know what a movement is?

trump's claim that clinton started the controversy is false. you can read more here &amp; here
incorrect. research mark penn, 2007 chief clinton strategist.
there is no memory hole, folks.
but there sure is a big ass hole....
im so excited
im counting down the damn seconds
this is a perfectly normal media event perfectly. normal.
have close exprnc w/this type. gov bebe had2 help &amp; it reached state supreme court
one thing you can't convincingly be right now is shocked. i vote for everyone calmly reporting that trump lied, then moving on.
i'm shocked that he managed to walk off the stage rather than droning on for an hour.
all good tho
it was fun tho
donald trump: “president barack obama was born in the united states. period."

we've got a feeling you won't leave disappointed! keep us in mind, okay?!
i most definitely will :)
what? i cannot. he's the one who started it. wow.
he didn't just start it, he's kept the questions going for five years since obama produced the birth certificate
how about giving unselled items to homeless people at instead of throwing them in the rubbish?

ok now i'm confused lol
let's start over. hi chloe !!! how's your day going ?
by "network news" you refer to media neutrality. by the way, washington post confirmed hillary started obama birtherism.
no, they didn't.
ok guys, and i challenge you for the best photo caption on here! be creative 😉
for sure that is photo shopped. it can't possibly look that good!

i already have infrastructure to do that for other cases, it's just annoying. twitter should really hire me to beef up their search api.

it's so ugly that he (probably) was involved in this ugly cover up and is definitely at fault in its continuance.

if there were more like you, i bet that brick and mortar store wouldn't be closing.
on the upside...i helped some kids learn a thing today.
except i fucked up while i was helping them with their second problem and well...yeah but that's when the teacher called the activity over
hillary aide mark penn's '07 racist "birther" strategy memo, to use against obama cc:
where's the part that says hillary didn't believe obama was born in the usa?
to recap: even as trump reversed his birtherism he still perpetuated another lie - that birtherism started with clinton's camp in '08
now people start looking at what hrc actually did during the '08 campaign. it's still doesn't look good for her........
so first debate for trump: if obama was born in the us why did you keep questioning it?
because there was such a shroud of mystery bo should have just put the bc out
how is bojangles not commanding a serious lead
agreed. can't believe there is even a poll for this.
understanding the constitution isn’t merely an academic exercise. it’s essential for democratic participation.
shocking is a gross understatement
they have not received my phone at the palo alto store!!

it's so ugly that he (probably) was involved in this ugly cover up and is definitely at fault in its continuance.
the devastation inflicted on that campus by those actions is unprecedented.
the birther issue is not important to americans, its only important to the left wing media because they're the ones that keep pushing it!
shut the fuck up

another thiing-clinton coverage been overwhelmingly neg. trump has gotten free pass on trump u, trump foundation hiding taxes
we cannot allow ourselves to be divided by the bigoted, xenophobic hysteria the republican party has concocted.

here is the top of trump's speech - the gop nominee promoting his new hotel at campaign event:

you need to look at two things right now: the standings and a calendar.
kudos to msnbc. check out the middle chyron below. they inserted "falsely."
except that face of is still there!
while we're on the topic, he also implied the white house murdered someone to keep obama's birthplace secret.
i don't even have words man. dude is on some other shit.
, does this meet your standard for "skillful"?
u have to try to overcome ur depression about trump

i experienced the same in greenwich, ct. i was the first in the store. :( walked out empty-handed.
you had a reservation for pick up too?? will they call you later?
luckily towns, cities and all things related to it is my actual background ;) second nature to design them :p
sure but will your town be floating in black void like that in the game? how will you handle the border of the terrain?
i would not hype it unless i was actually impressed. and i was so much more impressed than i thought i would be.
i believe it. all the previews look wonderful
if you had to design 30 minutes of politics to break mainstream journalists out of their false balance problem, that was it.
impossible. economics are stronger than ethics.
lmao this is my girl
oooh okay that makes it a little better
johnson is pulling away votes from trump. they're more terrified of stein because she's so good.
actually johnson is pulling from both. it's ok, see you in trump gulag. we can share bread

lobbying, petitioning the gov't. gov't action will impact many people, some very significantly. right to
i agree completely. i am not against lobbying.
why? trump's an entertainer, he got media to watch him entertain--plus he admitted sun rises in east, gets "credit".
i think mckay's onto something. his moments of greatest hubris hurt him every time. and debate frame now set.
lol why not give them a proper employment contracts then
weta: we love our people!!! also weta: u need to work 80 hours this week, what is a "sick day" lol yr a contractor!!!

let's be clear , trump is not doing this cuz he suddenly thinks pbo was born here, his camp is making him
he was adamant abt this all to delegitimize pres.
samsung will start selling the galaxy note 7 again on september 28 -
is there a huge difference in battery between note 7 and gs7 edge
me too! i'm excited to see so many people for the first time!

it's pretty clear—as president, trump would put his personal interests above the country's:

not just sad. pres. nominee just lied in front of america denying role in founding the birther movement.that's news
hope this dominates the news today, but just wanted to say great speech by last night, really effective.
let's be clear , trump is not doing this cuz he suddenly thinks pbo was born here, his camp is making him

trump, clinton are nearly tied in new michigan poll | the daily caller
i cant believe they r tied, seriously?? what crazy morons are voting for hillary???
does anyone have any doubt that trump would view the presidency primarily as a way to enrich himself?
his campaign headquarter rental bill agrees with you.
guys remember when obama took down trump within hours of authorizing the bin laden raid
yeah, thank god that was the key moment in trump not winning the nomination
let's be clear , trump is not doing this cuz he suddenly thinks pbo was born here, his camp is making him
pushed a racist conspiracy theory.
why isn't president obama working instead of campaigning for hillary clinton?
have someone read the constitution to you: 'cause you r a "domestic security threat" which he is sworn to protect us from
you might as well smile
you just made me smile! thanks! love you glen! thanks 4 all the years of making us smile laugh &amp; cry, god bless
actually you are wrong. it's okay tho, most real americans don't believe the medias lies.
you're either an idiot or a con-artist if you think hillary is responsible for birtherism.
people will never be able to recall 95% of the good things you do, but they'll remember 99% of the shady stuff you've done.

wouldn't be a problem if ya wasn't so damn obvious
let’s hope. remember how the media stopped asking about clinton’s emails (maybe)? maybe this is the turning point.
i said it this morning:media would fall for latest scam &amp; give more free time to lie - they love the shiny object

i mainly meant tapper, who did a good job stating point-blank how full of shit trump is on both his lies.
still not enough. the criticism cannot simply be of trump. it must be of the media system that is enabling this.
trump campaign manager joins us sunday to discuss the race, so tune in!

. immensely grateful for the burgers and wisdom we know we can rely on from you!
...as if i haven't watched it multiple times already
how can you not? it stars the pride of lexington, ky.
compare the washpost and nyt leads. post is the one that bothers to mention trump's false accusation about clinton.
it also took, like, half a day for nyt yesterday to update story about flint pastor to note video showing trump full of it.
does anyone have a bank (for business accounts) that they love? looking to move somewhere better.
i am super happy with chase.

oh good. like all babies, a few days late.
i would love to hear what the talk is in the white house this morning. erdogan just making things worse in syria
obama needs to face reality with turkey. west needs to recognize kurds and rojava, wests only friends in syria.
swish, swish,
starting fires... 😂😂
freelancers: what health insurance do you use? haven't been on market for a while. looking to compare against cobra
i'm on oscar and i hate it
it was also proven that the dnc rigged it so killary would be the nominee. dnc screwed sanders badly

awesome enjoy
that's precisely the next move i'm wanting to make!
congratulations on your success.

same here! i use for some things, but not sure i'd want to lean on it yet for customers/users.
.. here's your answer to whether you should go all in matt ;)
that stunt was the most vile, insulting thing i’ve seen this campaign season.
i am sickened. anyone voting for trump is an idiot.
trump didn't start , it was michelle. trump just took her word. she can't be wrong...or is she racist?
she is definitely a racist, she hates caucasians
section 8 where they can move in a nice neighborhood. stay in your lane. if they want better housing they can move
you are the cookie cutter politician who has been keeping blacks thinking they're too stupid and can't complete with the rest
(i'm not entirely convinced.)
i know exactly what show he's talking about. it's actually not. think of three judge judys presiding over a case. that's it
you doing it from a laptop or from icloud? i always just post up with my laptop before wiping the device and leaving store.
icloud — should have done laptop

mark don't u have something to do?
trump is not fascist the 3 defining features of fascism are fear, entitlements and state appropriation of the private sector

harry reid goes off on donald trump: "what a liar!"
reid is the liar
but it was trump who has consistently advanced a dishonest narrative about the president's birthplace.
those not willing to vote hrc (understandable) keep scotus in mind. push for a progressive nominee
i've been in class all morning with last night's yankee/red sox game on my mind....... i'm still bothered by it smh
like i feel we won't beat them again for the rest of the season.
the are losing big time!! makes desperate gamble with her birther movement and loses big time!!
that she did! disgraceful woman
most embarrassing update ever made by press home to unlock; we want slide to unlock in

i am so excited for this vlog. 🙈💁🏻🙅🏻💀
the tea will be served
she was sooo dead ass serious too 😭
what's a asian type ? like korean chinese japanese ?
donald trump backed off birther claims: "president barack obama was born in the united states, period.”
the idea that he makes this statement without noting that it was knowingly divisive and intentionally so is simply unacceptable
deff gotta put dave east in there
yeah he up there for sure but q and nino are dead nice af

thanks kencell, be sure to hit my line
i'm thinking this whole donald charade is about making $, like a businessman would do. today's "announcement" at his new hotel is an example
so, as a businessman donald will appeal to a certain customer type, and then expand the base by vilifying the competition.
you mean...it stars the two men i'd actually consider marrying?
but only one who has voiced a cat.

hillary campaign plays ""i feel good" by james brown as she walks on stage. (james brown died of pneumonia).
thats so ironic! james brown was a wife beater, he deserved to die

shut the fuck up.
trump campaign manager joins us sunday to discuss the race, so tune in!
i have to ask, why do you interview people who do not answer your questions? as a viewer its infuriating.
q is there a challenge in terms of public perception if % of investment in development is earmarked for m&amp;e and now open data?

george you're are absolutely right our is working tirelessly to protect us from trump!
"hillary clinton's support of palestinian terrorism"
media's support of hillary
so, as a businessman donald will appeal to a certain customer type, and then expand the base by vilifying the competition.
if you look what he's done, is simply sales 101!
honestly i'm just done letting my people be disrespected and walked all over. we're not here for your damn entertainment and exploitation.
this whole world got me fucked up and i'm not with it.
why are people still poking me on facebook
because your white 😂😂😂😂
, you know there's race as white, it's an invented term meant to cause classism. they are americans from european descent.
stop, no one needs an obama lecture, we need trump action for jobs and sensible healthcare
even fox news says hillary clinton didn't start the birther movement.
. rut roh! trouble in trumpistan?
what ails general hospital?
good read . but your take on the vante/lante s/l .. not sure i agree

the blue curtain at the back of the ballroom in the trump hotel just collapsed, taking down some american flags with it.
that was me and
why do people keep asking trump re obama's birthplace? guy's been telling us for 7 years what he damn well thinks!
trump either is a stupid man or doesn't believe in us law &amp;order.it is like saying trump is a woman.

hate you both
one minute she hates my guts, next minute i'm in hers
here's the other:
:o. so majestic, so perfect. thank you!
anyway, enough of that. you seem like a good guy (tl browse) and arguing over silly stuff is... well... silly.
all good, cap!
yes! i read when it first came out. crimes were unheard of! well written. couldn't put down.

cannot agree more. thought fitz was lost forever at that point in the game
he plays the media like a stradivarius. and they love it, as it generates ratings &amp; revenue. we're in big trouble.
as a voter, i don't allow the media to sway my opinion of dump. unfortunately, most of the public are intolerable and racist.
hey sam whats this?
and told me all the cool kids did it.
lol.. both are making $$$ -- while you shoring up hillary &amp; the others shoring up da donald. how about getting them to make u$
a company/service provider has no duty to make their customers money. corporations, like donald's, are in for themselves.
cuz no one wants ur bf
ok son. i'm glad to hear that. thank you for lifting me up on this fine ass friday afternoon.

i understand their role in black culture but i'm 99% sure it's not something that was exclusively to it
first of all, rastafarian and black culture are two different things and two, why is hair becoming a race thing?
cnn tone towards trump takes a definite turn, after birther announcement. john king "he played us."
i think it was monty python who had a segment on "getting hit on the head lessons." who knew it was dt's press pool?

i actually thought she killed it on her lip sync. it's so unfair how much shit she's getting when alaska.....
alaska admitted phi phi was asked questions!
received this email on 9/7 warning me something was happening. this means people knew weeks ago!
i wish i received it as well. my last submission was three days ago.
the next several days of birther coverage is really gonna get those white women in philly suburbs off the fence &amp; on board the trump train!
i've taken that main line train so often!
damn, somebody's dad took their tired ass, out-of-touch lecturing to another level.
that was soooooo incredibly tone-deaf and maybe even deliberately obtuse.
idk who told y'all to get turnt when you got a morning class 😩
lmfaoooo i wasn't turnt i was just maccinf
i'd like to point out that today is also the one-year anniversary of this happening at a gop presidential debate
ha. this was a precursor of all the gaffes to come.
if you aren't following 's lit af fantasy football thing, you're totally blowing it. it's incredible
damn, the teens kinda get it - i drafted my entire team based on attractiveness
no, it is very much not. not as long as i have a tv show.
it's not over. hillary can turn things around. she's not necessarily even losing though with co fading, maybe.
nice! i'm waiting and hoping for casper here... mainly for the mac management.
yeah casper is great.

actually being from dallas, moving to kansas now living in san francisco working with hiv &amp; aids group. its all about testing.
most gay &amp; straight dont get tested until its mandatory or symptoms. health insurance &amp; not believing straight ppl can get it.
you deserve this
no one deserves *that*
likes to charge before sending stuff. at least didn't charge me while i was still waiting for processing 😡
maybe if you chose the pink one you would have it by now? hang in there.

where in the constitution does it say under age child should obey a document rather than their teacher? free isn't good enough?
harry reid: i don’t buy the polls — “donald trump is a fraud.”
go trip on your exercise machine again!
a company/service provider has no duty to make their customers money. corporations, like donald's, are in for themselves.
the difference between donald and hillary is that he is a businessman ($) and she's a politician (power).
i am repulsed by what the man stands for, you should be, too. xenophobia, racism, nativism, protectionism, nihilism, ... 1/
save ur hide. delete all the talking points and talk like you. all your phobias and ism's are just old, like a damaged player
goodbye. but you know what you did.
i certainly know what you think i did, which is not at all equivalent to what i actually did. i'm sorry your life is so sad.
no, it is very much not. not as long as i have a tv show.
still, co, nc, fla are all close enough they can turn blue. she needs great debates and hersurrogates and her need to dom media
once again, please support ramsey orta. here's the donations link to his official site:
thank you for this ❤️✊🏾💚
worth saying that birtherism isn’t just something trump did, it is entire the foundation of his political prominence.
&amp; more reasons he'll continue playing that card 2 his benefit until most americans start rejecting him. he's a conman

i cannot take the despair of that episode of danganronpa 3. i need a hug. i need hope.
question: i'm assuming this is apart of the overall narrative, but can't be considered an adaptation of the next game.

appreciation. appreciate your loved ones, your many blessings, and appreciate your unbreakable will that gets you out of bed every morning.
make sure you give people the flowers while they can still smell them. when they're gone you'll either be left with fond memories or regret.

side to side live from the 2016 mvt vmas ft. nicki minay!
like... ariana with nicki together are like a bomb
it took her til the last day of the primaries and the super delegates to get enough delegates for the nom.
you were not following the dem primary very closely. hrc wrapped it up long before the 'last day'
no, it is very much not. not as long as i have a tv show.
if bernie, warren, obama, michelle and hrc can control the media and have great debates, they will win.

this is the best thing ever

pats go 11-5 with matt cassell, beat a superbowl worthy team today with no gronk or tom? yea brady a system player speak on it
the defense was like top 5 in the league that year. speak on that
the death of was "wrongful" enough for her family to get money, but not "wrongful" enough for someone to be held accountable.
i agree with you! when they are called to action it should be determined who will shoot instead firing unnecessary shots.
they hate you less
that's no longer a given.
this trump event was the most cynical thing i've ever seen a national candidate do, and i covered paul ryan.
yet, you were all there swooning so about what he'll be wearing, and what he will say. so many pimps so little news
trump now leads by more than 6 pts in national , ahead of clinton with likely voters in all age groups
why did you lie about sexual predator roger ailes, helping your campaign?
lmfao very brave .
only the brave survive
that's exactly what that means

i got another one for you: bad statistical methods
john king: “we just got played. we just got played. and voters can decide what to make of that."
anyone voting for is an idiot
psst: if you want the media to be more responsible—as i do—don’t make criticisms where you say all journalists are awful, or credulous, etc
will you settle for all major network "journalists" are credulous? anyone who appears on tv 3+ times a day is playing a role.
i hate this election.
it's actually the 110% worst one in our lifetime by a longshot.
hillary's intention is not only to bring black people "to heel", she plans to bring all of us to heel.
that skeleton is mad
nahhhh butcthat bitch is bad tho rt : 😂😂😂😂 niggas really said kash doll over bernice... i hate y'all for real lol
i love her bro but come on smh
yea if some girl came out the cut and called my bf handsome i'd keep my eyes on her 👀
right. but men pull a "oh thats you?!" &amp; then yal go play ball.
again, i agree to an extent. when a member of the ya community is genuinely hurt, or feel endangered in real life by death threats,
must be nice to have all of the benefits of a community without any concern for the safety of its members.
it's good (and dennis is super helpful), but ai still feels cold/abrasive/impersonable/wrong fit for users.
i hear you matt and hard at work. she is in good form though :)
here’s the thing: what do reporters do? protest him an not cover? he responds with “see? unfair!” plays his base.
i'm pretty sure there were few if any bridges left
i know, i support a bigot, hope i'm proud, i listen to what they both say and do, i will hold him accountable, ....
there was some rambling there. are you drinking during the day?

trump’s destructive validation of racists racial prejudice isn't 1 prob among many. it's a special category of wrong
yet it never exists unaccompanied.
some in the black community will not be satisfied, till they see white people getting lynched in america 😏
lumumba, then exile yourself from this great nation, spew your hatred elsewhere
are you guys ever going to enforce the "no smoking within 30ft of public entrances" rule, or do i have to die first?

i'm crying literally
that was the funniest shit ever dude we were crying. yan said fuck it and noah drank the shit too
pig trump was forced to admit obama was us born. so he had to do what he does best. lie.
is the candy trump used to attract the racists. they flocked to him like flies to shit.
lmfao how ima drive a caaahhrrr!!!??

rail wars is good actually
ok i unironically like rail wars tho

harry reid: i don’t buy the polls — “donald trump is a fraud.”
worse yet. if he's a fraud, what are they, his supporters?
nope, no you cannot. it's literally as if we're living in george orwell's 1984.
yo but its chill that barack was still cool enough with hillary to make her secstate even after she said he was born in africa
lol i don't have makeup on in that pic maybe that's why
lol ok that could be it. hope all is well homey
i need to do somethin with my hair
bleach blonde, lol
the birther issue is not important to americans, its only important to the left wing media because they're the ones that keep pushing it!
so true, because hillary has no other platform then to attack trump, she has no policy period, only more of the same
that seems primed for account takeovers.
not if it just uses the standard “forgot my password” machinery.
😭😭 someone get this guy a ticket 😭

stop it. not true!
i had a similarly funny dream about this time last year. lots of celebrity appearances in my dreams for some reason
these are great and also this makes me want to start writing down my dreams again
oh is that why they aren't speaking? somebody let their bravolebrity status go to her head?
say it isn't so. steph and brandi are not speaking??? i see a lot of pics of steph with carrie.
if you're still waiting for our episode, it's friday. go outside. have a drink. enjoy your day. ticc loves you and will be with you soon.
i'm going to kneel right here damnit
after a long rest, this is what comes back with - division!!

i didn't see su's visits with bamba and randolph reported anywhere else. maybe they were, but i couldn't find it.
i don't think you missed it anyhow. i was just saying that general. i don't see it mentioned anywhere.
no one deserves *that*
she didn't text me to hang out so i am slightly sore about it
are you serious ...because you're clean! is all kinds of shadiness.
if that's an example of "cleanliness", i give up.
the more you know i guess :)
i mean, i guess that's kinda the idea. :3
the difference between donald and hillary is that he is a businessman ($) and she's a politician (power).
emotional rhetoric "adds" to the corporation's appeal (aapl and donald, for example). at the end of the day we're consumers
but this is all irrelevant. the fact is trump didn't allow the official pool to go with him, successfully avoiding answering any questions.
only correct thing to do in response is don't publish pictures from the 'photo opp' portion.
you going be one bruh from new york that used do this in 80's. we need this.
yeah his name was dapper dan. all the high end brands sued him n stole his ideas.
i told my mom to change her pro pic to one of her and i. instead she changes it to one of her &amp; sarah. close enough

the asian and russian made it an enterprise. either u dont make it out alive to get tested or the dont even allow raw.
unlike the movies, if u use drugs not theirs they dispose of you. u no good sick.
once emperor trump is crowned, you probably won't.
you don't seriously see him as an emperor do you? emperors were bloody, cruel murderers.

each candidate is so disliked, they lose ground when media focuses on them. now moving away from hrc to trump, so…
the conclusion: americans of both parties are full of self loathing.
the boss will detect that you are frozen and do a dash attack! thoughts?
great idea! dastardly!
will it be available (to physical sell) in portugal?
yes we can ship to portugal.

anyone else experiencing "cannot connect to itunes store" when restoring in app purchases on ios 10 xcode 8 beta 4?
seems to be down. get the same error just trying to update an app right now.
it was just a mess and everyone just went back to boring bs
real mess ... they went 180 .. i'm going to ask dom about it weekend lol
your a poster child for abusive governmental stockholm syndrome! sorry my delusional friend history only repeats.
see this is all just right wing jargon. meaningless.
shouldn't be getting heat just because i look "able bodied",
agreed that you shouldn't have offer yr seat, but it would be nice if one of the other straphangers in that 🚇 car did.
media liberals are raging because the "birther" issue was hillary's only ammo for the debates. trump just took it from her. haha.
the party's over for the media n dems.
so trump said clinton started the birther movement (she didn't), that he stopped it (he didn't) and that obama was born in us (he was).
which means the only thing that trump didn't lie about, was the lie that he himself made up and has propagated for years.
nothing trump can say will ever erase the fact that for 5 years he tried to delegitimize america's 1st black president w/racist .
- &amp;4 that, honorable non-racist americans even repubs with integrity, will remember &amp; refuse2 vote 4 him!
they invented this thing called shipping
ah yes, you can now ship rocks anywhere thanks to ups.
bye! rt : i appreciate &amp; respect everyone's right to free speech, but the politics on your feed are too much for me. i'm out.
thank you for weighing in on twitter. your tweets have exposed you as pensive, articulate, bright, nuanced, fun, witty and insightful.
oh yeah ill let her know because her marketing team now sucks. i just can't work for her. you know how old jamaicans are

i have 3 stages of high: space fox, interstellar fox, and fish.
yeah you do have a pretty low tolerance like
🏙👄u were perfect! u founded the obama birther movement..that'll never go away&gt; lies
✅ &gt;facefacts! is not only the founder of obama's birther inquiry, she is a
did hillary clinton start the birther movement? - our fact check from may w
factcheck if is genius. the man truly is.
it really b breakin my heart lmao playin wit action figures but talkin tough sis

happy friday! what book will you be reading this weekend?
hunger of memory....perfect read for a teacher in washington heights.
a certain video game company ive always wanted to work for emailed me back for an interview after i just started my new job....
you gotta take that interview
good luck and god bless
yeah follow up insult with your hypocritical self-righteous piety
happy friday! is ! be sure to tune in at noon!
just changed channels. roginsky unable to move past birther. she's obnoxious!
i am now going to the brand new trump international, hotel d.c. for a major statement.
"lie", you mean, donald. the word is "lie".
so are foundations
good foundations give out over 80% of the proceeds (ckinton's). corporations give out dividends to their shareholders.
producers are business people. their job is to generate revenue. they don't care about the integrity of the content.
did you catch the recent celeb jeopardy? michael steele, lara logan - neither of them knew current political events that were 1/
he handed her his book of stamps--he's the kind of man who keeps stamps in his writing desk. she peels one off &amp; sticks it to the postcard.
he says dryly "must be nice to be so rich." "what do you mean?" she says. "you used an entire stamp for a postcard," he says.
that's the right approach, to be fair.
you would think revoking press credentials would have done something but...so yeah, this will be all forgotten soon
cubs were a better tm. bull durham's error was huge. much much bigger mistake than buckner's.
flannery smoked that ball through leon's legs. buckner's was a slow roller detroit unbeatable ws that year. 35-5

eric trump circa january 2017: i had no idea i was tweeting the launch codes and i never heard of defcon 1.
for his fancy-dan education he's not too bright.
look what we found. cc:
good times you killed it that night dawg
the election is a big distraction from what we should be doing with our time and energy!
incredibly huge distraction, waste of time and resources...
it’s always sunny in san jose, stefan ;) what are you doing out there?
almost always… tell u at insight .. flying out today
update: trump, who long trumpeted obama birth conspiracy theories, flip-flops and says pres. obama was born in us.
i didn't know that the "flip-flop" rules of presidential politics applied to . msm says they don't.
just yesterday, trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the united states.
no no now now transparecy...your campaign said it first...

ecstatic! minus the hangover lol. fitz is the man . my auto correct capitalizes that and melo. lmao
great example of asking tough questions to both sides. here with a trump spox and a hillary surrogate:
:we all know that megan kelly is one of the most vindictive network talking heads. hates trump 4 outing her
the calm before the storm. let us know how that long run goes.
will do, i'll be running it with you guys at the 57th st store here in nyc
in my 76yrs i have learned ..please do not try to convince a liberal with facts. it confuses them.
you're right, it nevef works. you have to turn their own words back on them. just ask them questions, they usually cant answer
sitting on a flight- if anyone has a question shoot it my way &amp; will do my best to answer....
why no red/white scrimmage? is there going to be an open practice at msg?

is this leading to a lot of time unaccounted for?
more like matching drive times to receipt and toll tag times. showing where he could have been and at what time--lp
i could lead you to several articles but you'd most likely dismiss them because you're a reality denier
oh really? show me evidence. evidence. that's reality. accusations, opinion, twitter posts are not evidence. you got it? i'll wait.
yo chris wanna get boba guys after you pick up your phone?? (i need a boba emoji...)

do you think it's feasible to slow down, though? we consume content faster than ever it's crazy.
i do. i consistently refer back to good content producers for recipes&amp;general reading enjoyment😻. i drift away if quality ⬇️.
we're so excited for your event in palo alto on september 29!
(or at least they did in 1975)
but why are they all wearing dress shirts to pull a dog out of a hole? via
maybe they're all just wearing "shirts"
no one cares. hillary's sinking like a rock. it's over.

watching reunion episode the entire team: (looking stunning)
it was on again?! i missed it the 1st time 😢
i didnt go to private school but know alot of friends that did and came out to do horrible life choices and didnt reach their full potential

watch your mouth that's my girl
my fault i thought she was single
fox news get this angry nasty bitch julie r off your show 12pm. many of us despise this witch. i changed the channel again!

top clinton surrogate in 2008 "repeatedly suggests that barack obama is a native of somalia"
trump finally admitted what everyone with an iq above 40 knew, that his racist effort to legitimatize obama failed.
before michelle obama, what livecast song would get stuck in your head over and over?
havana , robba and my next my back
it means that the chickenhawk militarist had his draft status of 1a mysteriously reclassified to 4f in 1968.
had he not used his father's influence to obtain reclassification you can be sure that he was headed for a section 8.
he says dryly "must be nice to be so rich." "what do you mean?" she says. "you used an entire stamp for a postcard," he says.
"it's only a postcard so you only need half a stamp." she looks at him for a while. then they both burst out laughing (because she knew.)
donald trump takes credit for “finishing” the conspiracy theory he helped start via
birth certificate and hair are real, he is a fake.
i feel like “entrepreneur” is one of those labels you shouldn’t be allowed to give yourself like “fascinating” or “brilliant.”
thank you! it's almost always a red flag when i see it on a linkedin profile.
think you would appreciate this! for real, not mocking. to kevin's point about chain familiarity
also i'm aware this is not chili's but similar sentiment :)
and we no longer believe the ap anyway.
bad, even terrible attempts to cover this insanity on social. yet ap is still the standard bearer

are you people serious? the man is fucking crazy
trump is a saint up against the most corrupt manipulative habitual lying manic to ever run 4potus
don't matter - both are not worth tweeting about -- wasting our energy. both are in it for themselves.
correct! in different manners.
thanks for hosting our group today . looks like lots of yummy nutritious food in the pantry!
always a pleasure having the team in to volunteer! thanks to everyone helping make our free pantry better than ever
we disagree on his performance last year. and yes, last week's loss stunk
he wasn't "great". but he made plays. finding a qb is hard
watching reunion episode the entire team: (looking stunning)
seems like i missed the reunion again 😢
i didnt go to private school but know alot of friends that did and came out to do horrible life choices and didnt reach their full potential
public schools only need the kids to "pass" while private schools need the kids to excel... they'll push your kids more
update: fled. i yelled "where are the details of your charitable donations!" at volume of man warning of volcanic eruption.
thank you for staying on this issue!
oak plan is out there. no public money outside infrastructure &amp; can't give you coli because a's have long lease
it is what it is. you can't pretend there's more that could be done given the circumstances.
what did he do
he had donald trump on his show, in front of his all-black band, and treated him like his best friend
. you must have flunked economics at fordham (when you didnt get into penn). your plan is jibberish
the differences between mc &amp; djt is mc's money is real &amp; djt's isnt his is borrowed or fake calculations
thanks for the tweet!
it's a *great* piece. important and very well written. keep up the great work!
you may want to check the delegate count, because you are wrong.
clinton won the primary by nearly 1,000 delegates.

i'm not gonna say who. great people though. some of the best, smartest people.
that's bastion not mei
bastion is the cancer, mei is chemo
i have a big surprise for you guys. join me on facebook live in a bit to celebrate.
i assume you announce to not endorse trump! what a great day it would be for such a statement!
wow thank you
there's no thanks necessary, keeping being yourself, i like it
why on earth?
doing something different i guess.
oppression is profitable
white supremacy is profitable
sorry but he lost me by giving that monster airtime in a fun-loving way.
yeah he lost me last night to. i know jf is a non political guy but he glorified a hateful racist and bigot
yo you talking crazy right now chill out
nigga fuck you. you and her can hum on me
trump admits birtherism is a lie. so, was he lying when said in '11 his "detectives" found "unbelievable" things about obama birth certif?
. trump probably has not been truthful abt anything since he learned the art&amp; potential profits of lying!
krauthammer: trump is a brilliant strategist &amp; he is playing the msm like a fiddle &amp; it is working
hillary is still sliding, run out of diatribes against trump, still doesnot dwell on policy; 23min speech to bash dt
he had donald trump on his show, in front of his all-black band, and treated him like his best friend
the internet is not happy about it
this is amazing
i love this
oh, wow! you ordered all the right things for sure. are you a san jose native?
san francisco native but i'm always driving all over the buy to try new foods!
no rambling, focused like a laser beam, sick of hypocrisy, lack of a balanced accountabilty by the media on both sides.
first time you've ever said that. the racism that this campaign brought to the surface is scary. fed on hate and fear.
help! there’s a really cute boy in my chem lecture with a life of pablo shirt. i am screaming

oh alison, i didn't know ❤️❤️❤️
that nj trip sucked so bad but we had so many laughs!
fucking donna called me michelle obama. fucking jungle hoe
we consume stories in headlines and statements. this'll show up as trump is not a birther, and people not paying attention will take it.
now i want to hear him admit that president obama is a christian.
we are proud to work with , , and to achieve plastic free seas.
plastic free seas. could be an ad for extraterrestrial tourists.

we're on the buses heading towards vandenberg. hold on to your butts!!

ooooooh she want a michael, she don't do jermaines (hehe)
prince with the hundreds yeah, purple rain (hehe)
donald trump ends his longstanding embrace of birtherism: "president obama was born in the united states. period"
birth certificate and hair are real, he is a fake.
"it's only a postcard so you only need half a stamp." she looks at him for a while. then they both burst out laughing (because she knew.)
they were good friends. but when i see people saying they don't get involved, i always remember that line: "must be nice to be so rich."
oh god yes.
lmao. just as well that i'll be in the air and ignorant for the next 10 hours.
a truth placed in a sandwich of two lies doesn't make a hero. it makes it a sh*t sandwich. (concerning trump birther announcement)
lol at the msm being trolled for free publicity. he plays all of you like a fiddle and you keep coming back for more.
just ran over a squirrel. not a great feeling. it had been a really long time.
better than swerving, but, yeah, never a good feeling. i'll pour some out for our furry friend.
so after 2 months of test of this mysterious huge mass on my dog.. i just found out she doesn't have cancer! i'm so happy. thank u jesus!!!

white supremacy is profitable
incarcerating black/latinx/indiginous peoples is profitable

hey and - you've given trump complete control of your air. he's playing you and you succumb. proud of yourselves???

america is one nation under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. not just for people who look or worship a certain way.
justice for all is something that means something else to you when it is time to take advantage of us

i mean - it should be disqualifying to only just accept that the current president was born in the us
given the length and fervor of his birtherism, he also can't imagine he won't have to prove his convenient new acceptance.

i love fahrenthold's reportorial transparency here. we can all follow along!
i'm guessing it'll go to the "trump foundation."
i mean - it should be disqualifying to only just accept that the current president was born in the us
as there is a difference between "accept that i've lost this fight" and "accept the truth i was fighting against."
typical hilliary acolyte. you want the same obama media (i mean cheerleaders) we've had for last 8 years?
or do we go back to the good ole days when republicans were last in charge. trump will be g.w. bush iii.
have gone up drastically in the last 8 years, time for a change,
they must really trust him based on the support he's getting. white people wanna choose who's best for black people. right
the whole dreads thing you guys should be attacking marc jacobs instead of the models you're just desperate to drag gigi and kendall stfu
they're just

when are you going to come out with the headline "trump is a birther"
the misreporting of this trump shit is alarming, giving that, you know, people are paid to deeply understand and interpret these things.
no wonder people who aren't paid to be skeptical are misled not only by politicians but also lazy writers and "social media professionals"
i have it but haven't read it yet as not sure. i'm glad you said that!! thanks.
oh great book, well written and tragic story. i will say, get tissues ready.

no child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if mom or dad will be there when they get home.

all you have to do is google it and you'll see that the donors and supporters started it. doesn't matter, trump wins easily
the fact that you think "trump wins easily" is all the proof i need to know where ur "proof' that hrc started it comes from. lol.
i know it's been a while since you worked here but it's still rivals, not bleacher report.
sorry, i had heard it was going to be a bleacher video, not a bleacher-style video. i'll get that changed.

smart move!
send me questions for today's video!
when are we expecting new music from you?
no but i've had my gums and teeth drilled. all that stuff just bothers me when it's not numb. like i said i hate the dentist
so have i and i hate that too but im telling you this was that x300
you're just a side
calls ricky to plot
trump: 'pres. barack obama was born in the united states, period. now, we all want to get back to making american strong and great again.'
okay, we conceded to the convention, and presumption. so, what does that mean in a "borderless world"?
fictional left right argument fail!
again these are just empty calories for the brain. you are the ideal trump voter
maybe i used it the wrong way but please explain the right way, thanks...
don't have an unbelieving heart to reject the grace of god in christ, it's an individuals choice.. that's what i think

yasssssss! fun night for all! 😉✌❤🎶
press 'shocked' that trump treats them as the cheap whores they are..
this coming from a member of the tin foil hat club/, who until today, didn't think obama was a us citizen.

the app is now crashing for me on startup every time. have reinstalled. anyone have any help? 😡
thanks for reporting this. can you give us any more information? os version and device?
what are you talking about? the tweet calls it bogus. this report, like others, debunks it
where does "given prominence" come from? it's (passively) about media/journalism - what you do. also, that lede/hed awful.
and here is the clinton campaign's latest focus...will it work? how will donald trump handle?
this is so weak and yet you all try to make a big deal about voters don't give a hoot about👎👎 try doing your job just for kicks

3) and no one else is in the room to help. just me, you and a broadcast crew. deal ?
you don't even need the broadcast crew... just do it on the interwebs, the smart channels will pick it up.
let’s just say i have a hard time accepting abby wambach of any sort of arbiter of “sportsmanship”.
haha that makes sense
"we have a chance to show that comprehensive immigration reform isn’t just the smart thing to do—it’s what the american people demand."
i would run it by the millions of unemployed blacks first. or are the non deplorable too good for work?
trump saying at this point "uh, i'm not a birther" has all the weight of jet li coming out to hold a presser saying he's no longer chinese
he's all incredulous about it too. "president obama was born in the us, period." asshole, we knew that. you're the birther.
hey meet ... i know you two will have lots to share with each other including love of the nice guys
thanks! very nice to meet you. can we connect? i followed you please dm your email

the app is crashing upon launch on ios 10. would like to see some affirmation, that you are working on fixing that!
can you let us know which type of device you’re seeing the crash on?
is it "i ate so many scrambled eggs this morning that i feel sick" or "i ate so much scrambled eggs this morning that i feel sick"?
many. each of the eggs you ate was scrambled.

some level backgrounds before we add lighting &amp; shadows
this is pre-lighting? looks sick!
yes, it's a muslim designer including hijabs in her line. not even comparable to what marc jacobs did.
what's wrong with models wearing fake dreadlocks at a fashion show?
supporting families with paid family leave, earned sick days, and affordable child care isn’t a luxury—it’s a necessity.
being able to get a nice house, a nice car, eat well, stay warm should be the result of my hard work. not taxes
basicalllly. you get out at 10? or are we meeting at 10?
get out at 10, we'll scoop you
yes yes yes!!!!!!!!

i miss you too! we'll have to find each other tonight!
yes!! do you have one of the express entry tickets or are you ga?
enough of allowing trump to play by different rules. if he can't conform, then he's out. what's wrong with that?
is making a mockery of our political system &amp; the must put a halt!
, oh 3 guys that fight for social justice, i feel honored, thanks. they are looked upon highly in the aa community. thanks
i knew it!! goodbye. not only are you the enemy of minority's everywhere, but you profit by further enslaving the uninformed

if you want time youll make time.
exactly! had to learn that the hard way, us women are stubborn lol
only 53% of adults are “extremely proud” to be americans—a 17% decline since 2003.
is the concept of nation an obsolete protection of medieval mercantilism? should nations still have borders?
if u watch the show, u know how important the iron throne is
the throne was supposedly forged by the dragon of the first targaryen king. he used fire to melt 1000 swords into a chair
. honestly digging it so far. question is are you guys liking all these videos in your feed?
the only way it could be more spammy was if i were at the empire state building! actually not far from!.. ;p
yup i remember reading up on him. companies was really hot because he was accumulating more than companies put together.
he was fa sho eating. all the big time drug dealer fucked wit bruh
sure the press are mad at trump he has expose them as what they are puppets for hillary.
yeah when they show videos of him proving he is a liar, he makes them look stupid, right.
i'll miss relentlessly good cheer on weekends! fun &amp; honor to share the stage with her these 3 yrs.

was the fallon thing that bad?
yes fallon is spineless
"there are a lot of very, very evil people...we have to be prepared. we have to keep our country so great and so strong." -
yup. and open borders just invite them to come here!
at the end of 2013.. it sounds like a while.. but as i've found.. and you know.. you always have your mum.
it sounds like yesterday. i think it will always.
dear , trump saying anything about birtherism is not a "big announcement." please, stop.
it's all about eyeballs.
a lovely... fifth alternate. (sic) “trust the duchess” &amp;
she may not be an actress, but she is a fierce queen!
it might be too soon to speak but stef &amp; her dude might be the only solid couple i know. ive looked all my life.
we love you dude 🤘🏽😭 ugh we appreciate the love!!
questioning the place of birth for eligibility to be president = racist? only for obama? nobody screamed racist when they questioned cruz
is canada a state?
i've talked about it before but this is the year i host a henny &amp; hot chocolate onesie function
that doesn't sound appetizing. i'll bring champagne for myself.
wow i use to be cute
that shirt lmao😭
hey guyz 🤘😁🤘🍻
good day simon cheers 🍻🍻🍻
here's the show's depiction: pretty badass, scary
this is not what it should look like! the author has said again and again that his version of the iron throne does not look like this
the thing w marc jacobs is you're inherently operating out of a place of ignorance. humble yourself and apologize.
it's fashion... nothing wrong with it. it's the people that are offended who are ignorant. fake dreadlocks are everywhere.
all you have to do is google it and you'll see that the donors and supporters started it. doesn't matter, trump wins easily
if we can attribute what "supporters" say to the candidate, then according to david duke your guy is a real white supremacist.
wait. the verizon model has all the t-mobile bands this year?
according to everything i have read yes
"this is a time where we need our military, perhaps, more than ever." -

the donald trump routine
lmao! i be feelin' like that sometimes. keep lovin' each other maaaan. blessings y'all way! prosper.
thankful for people like you 💓🤘🏽
trump today: 270 words on his hotel. 67 words on birtherism.
the way he speaks is just....off. like he's had a mental break or something
at the end of 2013.. it sounds like a while.. but as i've found.. and you know.. you always have your mum.
it's like having and losing at the same time.
the best would be to do one on all the top alternates
😭 have a good one guys!
do you think owes president an apology? (cc: )
no. absolutely not!
soccer season 🙏🏼⚽️
when's cuddle season?
sunday, 9/25... walk💜, eat, drink and win💙💚
our plan isn't to go back to carlow but, we'll be cheering them on! &amp; any that want to walk our more than welcome
how sad it is: trump admits obama born in us and that's considered news.
the dumbing down of america is complete. trump has made being ignorant chic; a badge of honor. the philistines may rule america!
i think it also depends on the public school. in mine the teachers &amp; counselors were very strict &amp; always pushing us
smaller is better too
when you've lost you're confederate flag but still want everyone to know you're a racist
still haven't seen a hillary sticker or sign anywhere in my blue state?

very nice! how long of a run did you get to take this time?
thanks! we ran for an hour :)
oh, great then! so, what makes you think that this wasn't what bishop oyedepo meant? tell me...
he clearly said "not once saved always saved" that is not scriptural, once you're born again you can't be condemned again
michael kors. marc jacobs still has standing as far as apparel/influence
oooh ok ok. thanks
😂😂😂😀😂 ohhh god!! this is awesome
he forgot to add the third line :p
a space for "no" is a data point, but will starve without the larger landscape. recently i &lt;3 "aligned autonomy" label
orgs who say you've got that open space without the other components won't be sustainable. that's my kvetch.
when you thought you sent one ☹️
when he didn't
his campaign people have said this before. he wouldn't say it today. so this is not news until he says it.
you got your answer asshat
i don't watch any of the whores on fox
got rid of more right anchors think judge pirro and hannity get axed
wait. the verizon model has all the t-mobile bands this year?
i'm using a verizon 6s on t-mobile and everything works as well. is this a new thing? i've been working fine for months
the bizarre true story behind the “this is a work of fiction” disclaimer. it involves : via
because reality is stranger than fiction, we need to be reminded "this ain't real".
if you had any idea the kinds of emails i got from future trumpkins by opposing birtherism in '11 and '12-and donors i lost for
the question remains why the republican elites did not shut trump down when they could have.
that's a horror film lol
😂😂your on your game today must be sober 😳😳
this is not what it should look like! the author has said again and again that his version of the iron throne does not look like this
his envision matches this image: towering, menacing, uncomfortable ugly.. a metaphor for how "painful" it is to rule
yup i remember reading up on him. companies was really hot because he was accumulating more than companies put together.
not only that ppl wanted his shit more than the real louis. it's because he made things that urban ppl could wear.
it’s silicon valley def of design thinking that i find so problematic. i agree architects don’t think like lawyers.

happy birthday birthday pretty girl 😍🎂🎉
thankyou beautiful ❤️
she doesn't have many of those, unless fundraisers are "clinton events" and donors are "surrogate speakers."
hillary doesn't need surrogate speakers to hold her hand &amp; praise her endlessly lime cheetonazi does
i'm imaging w/deploystudio right now, while great for the initial setup, i want users to be more self-sufficient via a casper portal
oh cool. i’ve been using the built in tools in os x server for imaging our macs but we only have 26 so it works well.
folks: do we want another prez who lies about our security? no! knowledge=power. empower yourselves!
so why vote trump? change the motto to "trump lies and flip flops on everything, but we don't care"
the most important word in washington today: lie
actually, it's two words: big lie. see: goebbels, joseph

oh, great then! so, what makes you think that this wasn't what bishop oyedepo meant? tell me...
we are sealed by the holy ghost, even if you backside and fall in sin, once you're truly saved there is no condemnation
i mean he just has a history of letting shitty shitty people get free press on his show w/o askin any actual questions
and trump is the worst offense
. . then what the hell was clinton apologizing for? seriously take your head out of sand
well said! the world is blowing up around us &amp; she focuses on this. seriously?!??

wow. cnn: the pool tv producer was physically restrained from going on trump's hotel tour, to prevent any questions.
why? what was said on tour? speak to anyone there??

ok i'll do that. well, my chores are calling. yelling-lol catch up in a bit!!

i thought the ex aridi testified she picked him up to go to legacy on saturday 8/30...?
she could have driven his car. sasso said that.lp
if trump wins it gives weight to idea you can say anything in primary and "pivot" for general election. apparently people have no memory.
the multitude of position reversals is astounding. even more so that people continue to believe him.
about time you on this shit 👏🏻👏🏻
nigga still don't gotta tweet 😂😂😂😂
true, &amp; hopefully i can get things to turn around. it never should have gotten to this point!
good luck with everything 💪🏻
you a place to rest your beer and someone to confess to?
among other things
trump finally says president obama was born in the us
that's not the damn headline and you know it! shame on you! blames hillary, never apologies for years of disrespect!
donald trump constantly disrespects the media but like an abused victim, the media still love their abuser.
damn straight, and they keep coming back for more abuse.

i haven't seen the msft mobile comeback into grey in any public narratives among the technorati , just consumers recently
talking about driving a &gt;&gt;trump's ridiculous claim that hillary clinton started the birther movement
more lies 2 feed his supporters bcause without those lies &amp; innuendos he wouldn't b where he is today as a conman
as trump highlighted economy, opponents focused on other topics, attempt to push media conversation away...
obvious now hlry's whole campaign isbased on negatives and divisiveness. pity if it works as will prove her constuency deplorable
do we know how often he generally went through half a tank?
just filled up, then half tank.
go ahead. i sent one at halftime that said you'd win bc god ain't giving me a nd and fsu loss in consecutive nights.

nobody with an iq above 40 believes this. trump ran a racist charade for years.

53 days to go and climbing in the polls donald j trump does the biggest flip-flop in political history announcing that obama was born in us!
it's pathetic that any sane person is taking trump seriously, he's dangerous 2 america's national security.

i'd actually rather the car was empty, since it cuts down the risk of dooring or the driver's moving.
tbh i prefer someone be in it w/ windows down so i can share thoughts.
with what invitation? tuh
so long as i can get into the building, i know the code to your apartment. don't ever play yourself, scallywag.
like he didnt spend 8+ years vilifying a duly elected president. like the whole movement was motivated by racism and xenophobia.
like trump didnt try to pull the same shit with ted cruz. like trump didnt hire ppl who believe the same shit.

hahahaha this from someone who was dragged, unconscious, into a limo and disappeared to her daughters!
ok this whole tmobile and ios 10 thing is it only affecting peasants ?
seems like it cause i haven't had any issues
2) trump takes credit for “finishing” the birther controversy. he didn't.
3) this "presidential campaign event" with press in attendance was actually hotel launch promo
and like i said, you're skirting around the word. lies are pretty evident, especially with one candidate.
ready to say "lie" yet? or is it still too harsh?
this whole week has been rough not just last night.
what's wrong
how come all the boys tht fall in love w me can't spell the word definitely :// i'm not tht mad jus wondering tho lol
mandela effect. it was definately. swear on my life.
. tv critic scolds jimmy fallon: was it 'moral' to 'just have fun' with 'indecent' trump?
indecent? you deceive your readers every day and call someone else indecent? check out the splinter in your own eye.
nothing trump can say will ever erase the fact that for 5 years he tried to delegitimize america's 1st black president w/racist .
that pretty much nails it.
it's time to double down and support hillary. i'm serious.
oh god. now you've really lost it
it took me a min to realize that was my closet lol
yes your stylish walk in closet lol

oh, totally. and it was young poc who backed bernie, but of course none of these people live within a factual world
well, unfortunately i woke up
*fortunately
i gave up and left 😞 i was counting on reservation time being accurate. i'll go back later. good luck!
ugh yeah. i’m gonna have to do that soon if this line doesn’t move… 😭
obama was born on mars.
this i buy judging by the iran deal alone.
one of the candidates is on the defensive about birtherism at least.
it's hillary. i promise you it was her and her top strategist, mark penn
all these update and we still cant edit tweets.
bruh this tweet deserves endless rt's
we're now going to talk about hillary's role in birtherism, which is a total win for trump.
: we still remember when vindictive hilarity brought up lbama's foreign birth in kenya, as kenyans admit, including obama &amp; family.
we are alarmed to hear this, wink. please feel free to dm us with more information regarding this. ^eb
i just posted to you i will not be quit for my harassment

hey bro, just dropping a line to say that i loved your breakdown of art of war album. keep doing your thing man!
thank you ali!
why dont you cover segas boxing games?
buster douglas can go piss up a rope
lol was it at least for laughs? did ppl see it coming? would trump's team deliberately choose fallon for that reason?
yes and yes and yes and that's why it's scummy. fallon cares more about being liked by everyone than having a moral compass
i'm just gonna leave this here and then i'm done with last night's game, but could someone tell me why we pulled tanaka? 91 pitches in the
no strikeouts he had to battle. no one thought what happened in the 9th was gonna happen.
she's so fucking annoying
i hate her so much
i don't know who they are but you're right about "aggravating" 😬
i found out ... one is a prior nannie &amp; the other is a magazine editor. i'm still annoyed.
i just posted to you i will not be quit for my harassment
from i mean
note to , repeat after me: "do not let him get in your head" do not let him get in your head" "do not let him..." run your own race
&amp; should be the message the media must put out daily so the american folks can see trump as the professional conman he truly is!!
keanaaaaaaa! this world is way too small. joe has been hanging out with your uncle (shaylen's dad) lately lol.
hahaha i know shay told me she's seen him around the house a few times ! that's crazy

especially because it still renders like a regular gun on other platforms. it's more confusing now.
wait that actually is a good lineup
we are getting a group and going lol
yes and yes and yes and that's why it's scummy. fallon cares more about being liked by everyone than having a moral compass
even if it means petting a fascists hair on national tv
really? what "systems"?
sounds like a cheap excuse
hillary clinton linking her collapse to how women have to work harder in the office these days
throwing every excuse against wall hoping one will stick
trump's entire premise for saying "i finished it" re birtherism is that it's valid line of inquiry. it is not! racism is exhausting.
. we women think everyday before deciding where/how we go to be safe. blacks must do so 100x more. racism is exhausting!
get an old fashioned alarm clock!
i have two :(
shut uppp😭 just when i thought i was over snowglobe.........
dude it is so fucking fire like we have to go...!!!
.1) $10mm to the charity of your choice if you let me interview you for 4 hrs on your policies and their substance.
i bet you could get a couple hundred million contributed to make this happen. would turn down $200 mm? coward.
like trump didnt try to pull the same shit with ted cruz. like trump didnt hire ppl who believe the same shit.
like saying, "oh, i lied", is enough to forgive the 8 years of racist bullshit.
donald trump is poison for all americans he is crazy dangerous lying
speaking to the choir.. total agreement. now, how to get to the young ones so they see the light??

as 35-year nyt reader, former columnist, lifelong nyer, it's been painful to watch paper this year. (not you personally).
no, he's a racist.
yeah, that, too! definitely that.
odd that our measures of animal intelligence are often tests of what humans do best rather than of what they do best.
we judge robots the same way!
colourpop had a lip shade called gypsy and people were rightfully upset so they're letting fans choose a new name for it 😭
i know nobody should get a pat on the back for just being decent &amp; not racist but i've never seen a major corporation do something like that
after spending a lovely night in cambridge and taking the amtrak through new haven all i can think is "and rory chose yale?"

yes thank you for asking☺️ been so busy with family it's been crazy but fun crazy! you're the greatest take care🇺🇸vote trump 🇺🇸🚂🐘
ohhhhh good ...happy to hear that !! !!
thought about some sparklines: lack of common scale makes them meaningless. is it just me?
disagree. more interested in trends for each state than how states compare to each other.
“when i’m under the weather, i can afford to take a few days off," clinton said. "millions of americans can’t."
karma is a bitch hillary when it bites you; all that laundered money and no health !
hey —see correct wapo headline, unlike yr versions that fail on trump's prolific lying abt pbo.
add to list of outlets that reflexively expunged from trump's record his true mendacity over the birther embrace. please fix!
...is this a photoshop?
nah, david brooks talked about football and thanksgiving fucking, in the new york times
sounds like a cheap excuse
no idea. but they told people they could leave and come back any time this weekend. so i moved way up in line! 🤘🏻

as long as the pizza tastes good does it matter?
what happens to the millions of fast food workers, taxi drivers, mall workers, etc. we are talking massive unemployment.
it's now forever settled: is a lying racist piece of garbage.
be careful, that kind of rhetoric will only enhance image among his followers.
smh majority young poc hate the clintons. older poc are more conservative, the kind of ppl who supported war on drugs
yeah, of course. i just love when people weaponize identity politics like this
awesome. you'll have one before me. so will my wife. the world is upside down!
this phone is prettttty nice :) (so's the watch)
wow! of &amp; &amp; of legends! thank you for all you do!
thank you friend!
. secy. vilsack says he has no question has the strength of message &amp; character to win the election
hillary showed the courage of a player ,playing hurt, and still scoring a touchdown.
hi! it says at imdb that you and were classmates at usc. did you know each other well?
we were students at ~ ally was a year behind me and we knew each other.
this is key. press simply cannot report, 'this is what trump statement said' when it was all categorically false
if wins, racism wins and we can rightly expect his supporters rise to violence.
i know hahaha that's why this is so funny. she wasn't even slick about it at all 😂she had me screaming every time she did it.
i think he was trying to protect her and not say anything bad he was in game mode still protecting his girl

you're amazing inside and out. love you beautiful 😘💕
honestly so stoked it's friday, work killed me this week
then this isn’t the real marissa. get out of here imposter.
to close guantanamo, obama is now releasing terrorists that *his own task force* said should never be freed.

🔥🚨hillary birther🚨🔥 america's memory is so bad, they forget the 2007-08 clinton camp actually started
no it did not start with them.
but this is all irrelevant. the fact is trump didn't allow the official pool to go with him, successfully avoiding answering any questions.
is this what you or anyone would want in wh ? must be shamed and told outright he is a liar and manipulator
i don't care what none of y'all say, i'm fresh.

stay there woman
thanks for the rt, how's th big apple today?
clear &amp; beautiful. nice to take a walk around the city or if not. i'll usually head out to the beach &amp; feel the ocean breeze.
here's how trump treated veterans before he ran for president:
because there was no profit in veteran's issues back then. there sure is now.
hell freezes over, cows fly! the actually likes the economic plan.
because most of it is centered on growth, not government subsidies!
he's the nominee because he's a birther. his campaign is a sham. he's surrounded by white nationalists.
all a con game &amp; it's time most of us call it just that.
when u get a job at h&amp;m to stop being broke but you'll prob still be…

you get 18k and the jersys quicksell for 7.5 thats fine
lmao he literally pet his hair? he must have morals tho. has he explained himself? what exactly was the interview about?
yes and no he hasn't.and just watch it. it's about as substantive as an interview with an actor of a new movie
thanks! gotta give a shout out to studio mate who did the heavy lifting.

now that would be funny.
now that's the the kind of development worth pursuing!
if trump isn't a birther, does he regret leading the movement for four years? does he apologize to obama?
only took him four years to decide. very decisive.
not .015. it's 0.15 -- still ridiculously low, as you said.
what about the testosterone level? he's 70 and weighs a ton! total bullshit.

the number of trump signs along highway 99 in the central valley is both shocking and appalling.
imagining what any of these farm towns would be like if trump gets elected. the local economy would collapse in two minutes.
exactly that why we need somebody to be on game like he was back in the 80's.
well i'm here for the game bruh.
trump’s lies cannot go unchallenged: 1) trump has been an unrepentant birther 2) hrc has never entertained this racist conspiracy theory
not so. she did, per 2007 top strategist, mark penn!
happy friday! have a great weekend too 🌼🙂
thank you margie❤️

and because of pat little sayings just like this, the system needs direct actions, not words. it's all been said before.

if trump isn't a birther, does he regret leading the movement for four years? does he apologize to obama?

that is the only reason we watched. if it was on sat we would've watched our game or bama or oklahoma or uga..
lol cmommmm our game was the most anticipated game of the week.
she doesn't have many of those, unless fundraisers are "clinton events" and donors are "surrogate speakers."
i can't recall🚑
seems like most disappointing moment personally for trump of campaign was when he acknowledged our first black president was born in us. sad
but he threw focus back at her saying she started it. you cannot speak to an irrational person.

why are disparaging people with low iqs? are you some kind of racist?

i dont understand what's going on. i can't wrap my mind around why media/news just let this shit slide

after trump non-ambiguously says obama born in usa, press essentially vows to chase trump to gates of hell over birther issue.
since when did they stop chasing him?
it apparently came from fans of a gay av. pretty interesting stuff tbh
that’s amazing, one of the more convoluted evolutions of slang linguistics i’ve seen

this issue was 1st presented by hillary in2008! so, she is making a huge mistake saying it's racist!!
show me where clinton challenged obama's birth certificate.
trump jr. insists "gas chamber" remark was "poor choice of words," not a holocaust reference
why, people talk about gas chambers in polite discussion all the time. what's the problem?
it was, there wasn't another option like there will be on saturday. niggas just want to watch football bruh it's simple
oh no doubt. so why y'all be tripping when we tweet y'all. it's football we wanna watch.
do you know what ignorant means? 🤔 denotation not connotation? 🤔 i feel like you don't
what you feel is of zero importance to me. you're synonymous with ignorant....... hope that helps.
thanks, , for helping white people to understand that "can i touch your hair?" can be a horrifying question.
that was shameful, man, treating trump like some harmless outrageous cartoon rather than a dangerous bigot.

they're playing call me maybe now!!!
hillary clinton and donald j. trump trade barbs over obama 'birther' flap

guys! today marks the day i came out to my parents, 10 years ago!!! 🌈🌈🌈 after getting caught with my then gf... also happy birthday mom!!!
a celebratory day! this is my 10 year too! mines was in april. 🌈 mazel tov!
also, obama himself said he was born in kenya and raised in indonesia in harvard law review 1991. lie??
if you are so stupid to believe that, i am blocking you.
i gave up. ill deal with everything tomorrow after work 😭

sorry man, i missed your tweet and wasn’t able to find ya! hope you had luck getting yours!
going back in a few minutes to get my phone.
damn i wish i had seen this earlier! what’d you get?
after you're done restoring your iphone you get... this ui? that's it?
dat clarity
media—do not be gulled by trump’s claim to ‘believe’ pbo was born here—after conducting a 5-yr birther crusade.
after trump's stunt, i believe ppl will be so scared of him being prez, that the 3rd party vote drift may begin drying up. media shift, too.
the number of trump signs along highway 99 in the central valley is both shocking and appalling.
in other news, bakersfield has a maserati dealership.
trump jr. insists "gas chamber" remark was "poor choice of words," not a holocaust reference
just like his father was not mocking the reporter's disability
trump and clinton’s exchanges on health have been tame compared with past elections
hillary just couple days back was in bad shape, came back like a bull
he appreciates me for the princess i am
yea duh ofc you're a princess
q: how are we evaluating the settlements? a: it depends on the theory of dmgs: 1. risk of future harm and 2. loss of benefit of the bargain.
we like the second theory better because it leads to better settlements.

wait does metro carry iphones? the other 2 r for the kids.
donald trump claims hillary clinton started the birther controversy:
irrelevant. she dropped it. trump ran with it for no apparent reason.
i was referring to his expecting the press to act like thinking entities rather than entertainment reporters
who is "the press?"there's plenty of smart coverage.but for the traditional press, calling out lies is now media bias.
trump is about two days from attacking hillary clinton's failed casinos and raising questions about her sealed divorce from ivana.
spot on, it's the whatever i do sticks to you, mentality. and the media's force feed continually legitimizes dt's insanity.

say what you will about king solomon, he knew a thing or two about american politics
consider this a subtweet
lost in shuffle this am - trump attacked cosmo and reporter who interviewed ivanka/asked her about trump statements
trump's insistence on pursing every perceived slight would be disastrous in a world leader.
part of me wants a bath robe, but another part of me knows i would spend too much time in it. it would be a gateway drug to hard laziness.
i don't get those robes. wouldn't being wrapped in such a blanket, all wet, be.... uncomfortable?
damn. i mean, on one hand, that's not the role of talk shows. but otoh, he is kind of a fascist lol every opportunity to point
yeah i mean the show doesn't have to take hardline political stances but it also shouldn't act as a pr machine for literally
been covering the clinton campaign since the outset. this has never happened to us.
when is the press going to stop pussyfooting around this guy?
he should be tried in the icc in hague for over 100 fake police encounters and extra judicial killings
maybe he should join psp or police-pakistan :p
wow can't believe they stole my startup idea
new quest flavor? 🤔
my mom just referred to the city of kingston as "kinky kingston" for no discernible reason and i'm so confused
which kingston? ny?
i know it is soup. i'll try it if i see it in restaurants. as long as it doesn't have cream, i will probably like it
zero cream. tomato base. raw veggies. any decent mexican or spanish restaurant will have it. upscale amer. might
i don't feel sorry for the press because the press doesn't hold trump accountable.
no, i don't feel sorry 4 them, what i mean is he's treating press like theyve no right to cover him campaigner manhandled 1 of em
this is bs hyperbole, trump's conned media to greater effect for 30 years.
read a book on trump published before he ran for president, your ignorance is showing.
has this ever been screened in nyc before?
it has and i miss it every damn time!
not a claim but supporters started claim against '08 dem primary. watch 60mins hrc also
doesn't matter after he kept it going for 3 years
this is normal
and the 6s plus
this is essentially like talking to a brick wall. i'm done here.
matt it's exhausting
don't you have boards to study for 🤔
why you clocking me
spending $31 each week on a metro card pisses me off.
girl you better off with an unlimited
i can be silly but i'm not. research in lit might help. why do quotes stick with us from books written before we were born?
there is also research that shows large majority of published research in english lit is never referenced again.

yes they are a joke! if they were fair they would show with a 15 point lead.

you feel terrible.
yeah i mean the show doesn't have to take hardline political stances but it also shouldn't act as a pr machine for literally
anyone of a certain profile that asks to be on the show. letterman would have grilled trump
i love the idea that the first hour' s spent not on a current project!
yes! not always easy to do, but schedule it on your calendar like anything else. make it habit.

sony acts disgusted yet they're now denying people nms refunds over psn. gimme a break.
it didn't literally happen but it's pointing out that fallon didn't challenge trump on his racism, just laughed with him.
explain to me trump's racism. what about trump is racist?
sorry man, i missed your tweet and wasn’t able to find ya! hope you had luck getting yours!
still in line. they said the system went down but its back up now.
leave to the nascar guy. it's chick fil and it's not even that close.
blasphemy. y'all have a dang race named after bojangles.
but tell us how you really feel
i'm cranky and need a nap 🙃
i raised my voice bc you said you couldn't hear me 🙂🙂🙂
mhm whatever
where is this
hunter college
bummer that only 2/8 i've checked from my podfile so far have rendered change logs 😞
welllllll there is this from :
i wrote a long piece about some of the problems with startup equity:
good complement to my piece today: "the truth about next year's ipo 'rush'"
i like bernie, i wanted to see him and hear his speech
i figured that. i was making a joke because i don't care for politics
it's obvious you used low iq as an insult. it's a fact that the average aa iq is lower than those of whites. racist!
there is so much faulty logic here that i don't where to begin. so i won't.
you just contradicted yourself
i was being sarcastic all i'm saying is i just don't like it when artist make it seem like they're down to earth of that's not
trump is still refusing to say whether he believes president obama was born in hawaii. “i’ll answer that question...
trump-the-schlocksucker finally admits obama born in the u s of a. how cocky!
i'll think she'll arrive w/ plenty of facts/proof
but this isn't a normal debater. look at the primary debates. anything but the topic at hand.
out of town dude
i know but i just wanted to see the movie :-/ i hope you enjoyed
overdo birthday thingie for the great !
ohmygoddd ahhhhh ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️❤️ thank you for this!!
remind us next week before the game!
. follow and "turn on notifications for tweets with live video"
i don't. just find it strange that members in your fandom seem to always make it about us. i rarely tweet you dweebs
loooooool your our rival and we on a six game winning streak. the tweets gon go. you gotta expect that.
once again, the american news media gets totally played by trump. wall-to-wall coverage. we’re all guilty.
we're not all to blame. people in charge make decisions about what is "news" based on training, ethics etc; it'sjust a $ grab
also i know ny has some weird laws about putting stickers on things (fiancé went to jail for putting a sticker on a post)
whoa, that's a heavy price to pay for a sticker.
i wish these perf benchmarks had knockout, for a fuller picture of where we are. that data exist? /
or backbone
if restaurant that does not compete on volume (e.g. not mcdonald's) has low-$ kid's menu, does that suggest their adult food margins high?
of course it's too much to ask for yelp reviewers to make sense, but i saw one complain that a tiny cheap-ish diner doesn't have kids' menu
well, it's my dune fan's golden birthday today! could you please give a shout out to esau? thanks!
🗣happy birthday esau!🎂
we like the second theory better because it leads to better settlements.
our theory in the new adult toy case is that ppl would not have bought the product if they knew abt its practices.
im at the hard rock cafe in philadelphia
did u get a shirt or shot glass
i was being sarcastic all i'm saying is i just don't like it when artist make it seem like they're down to earth of that's not
the case of its just about the money let it be known especially if people feeling you
i can be silly but i'm not. research in lit might help. why do quotes stick with us from books written before we were born?
can't win me over to position of "it's all good and beyond reproach and we need more please"
just watched that video and i'm in tears. this issue will forever break my heart.
me too, i am so sorry
is this a rhetorical question?
bring it if you have an answer
you must do some home work before you tweet next time. go find out what the 3 ministers did in brazil.
well have you done the homework? cm on medical leave, delhi is almost in icu and deputy cm goes out ..

you waste money on drinks all the time
you haven't seen me buy a drink in years though...
huh -- mine restored (through itunes) before updating. was yours backed up through icloud?
i'm not sure i have a working install of itunes anywhere.
started learning japanese this morning ... i wonder if it will be harder or easier since i barely know english.
hard as fu*k more letters in its alphabet and harder to pronounce
nothing trump can say will ever erase the fact that for 5 years he tried to delegitimize america's 1st black president w/racist .
we have free speech and freedom of information. the racism card is going the way of boy called wolf.
i am now going to the brand new trump international, hotel d.c. for a major statement.
hahahaha great speech today tricking the media into following all your military endorsments
i think my beyoncé concert was better than drake this summer but honestly they both gave me life
i was physically dead at drakes concert right until i heard his voice and i rose from the dead
ahahah, i'd totally consider sydney but i'd rather take over maintainership of vim than work on jira. :)
that can be arranged
great piece, you weren't the only one screwed over by
those fuckers definitely recovered a lot of their cap table from fired employees circa-2012.
in the spirit of and i present 's : pseudogeneric thunks
ooh that actually looks closely related to what i’ve been writing this week. i should update.
i can't take the girl. but if they showed 1 episode instead of 6 per evening, i could live w it.
yeah, that's the annoying part. they're doing all back to back stuff and it becomes really annoying. it's not the same now.

that moment when you find out there’s no this season…
but they gave us shark themed beer so that's something right? or nah?
i was physically dead at drakes concert right until i heard his voice and i rose from the dead
i dead napped for like 45 minutes at the concert 😭
when donald trump jr. isn't retweeting racists, he's busy lying. it's a genetic family trait
every newspaper &amp; legitimate network should be demanding what is trump hiding? his tax returns are essential to the public's right to know.
of course it's too much to ask for yelp reviewers to make sense, but i saw one complain that a tiny cheap-ish diner doesn't have kids' menu
often a wait for table there. it would be horrible for such a place to fill limited seats on break-even meals. this isn't rocket science.

my test is always walking through an ice. the new ms stuff is still minimal against ipads and *bulky* plastic laptops
i think the surface is too expensive still for most; but this will change within a year
it took years for the almighty trump to 'legitimize' our president and he does it now for publicity and black votes
he's deluded if he thinks today's antics got him anyone's votes
set my alarm to wake up early and do stuff. wind up falling asleep every time i try to get up. it's work season, all right. :/
anyway, hello everyone. welcome back to crazy ramblings with your host, cityflyer502. i don't know where i'm going with this. :p

the key was the play never gotten before the play clock went to zero and then the pick play that was never called.
i really don't want to go to yoga today. i just want to stay at home and wait for my .
but i'm on my way to school right now because i'm such a perfect student and my class is like 70% participation.
but will trump release long-form, written proof that he was wrong about the president's birthplace? 🤔
u &amp; the rest of the media should report this daily until election. would be justice if this is the lie that takes trump down!
very cool. travel safe!
thank you! my grandma is super excited .
huh -- mine restored (through itunes) before updating. was yours backed up through icloud?
p.s. you have the best twitter bio in the universe.

over time, being able to effectively curate your timeline will result in a healthier twitter experience for you 👊🏼

trump blames birther controversy on clinton
this man is truly pathetic
the most striking number here may be that 99% of americans 18-29 do use the internet. it is now universal.
that is amazing. there are towns where kids congregate outside the police station for the wifi. (read: uses != has regular access to)
in the past week my iphone 6s+ battery has been draining like... anyone else?
yes totally useless after an hour or two and unexpectedly shutting down while the indicator days 20-40% left
yeah. sorry this is happening. again 🎥

i agree. i'm @ a turning point in my relationship &amp; i needed to read this today. thanks....
the question is the bank shot--can hillary use birtherism, an attack on obama, as a means of generating enthusiasm for her candidacy?
if obma truly at 50% approval rating its probably a wash. still, she's concerned about her base
hopefully i'll be back in like a month or so it's kinda boring here since i can't talk to anyone i'll hit you up when i'm back tho!

hillary clinton is a moron. you don't win votes by attacking people. didn't the last 8 months prove that?
hrc is incapable of learning. no matter how often something doesn't work, she just keeps hitting the repeat button.
let's be clear the press is no victim, they enjoy every second all that 💰💰rolling in. zucker, moonves &amp; lack.
ur missing my point. in fascist countries they deny the press access. this is what i am talking about

i usually use soy but i'm open to trying anything lol i like mild sweetness
that verse kills me every time 😭
that entire song honestly 🤕
trump didn’t apologize. he didn’t even really acknowledge that he was wrong. then he hustled off that stage like the coward he is.
. - didn't watch it (wasn't worth my time) trump &amp; his campaign has proven 2 b a 4 ring circus. msm making big $$$!
just think how amazing our world is going to be in their hands! &lt;3

spokeo said that the plaintiff needed a real life "owie" ('s words). but rejected that test.
our view of is the test is whether the harm was something that congress contemplated while passing the statute.

the racism card is so "boy who called wolf" you better choose your words carefully

we need a fiscal plan to put us on a sustainable path. tweet to ask clinton &amp; trump for their plans in the debate.

could like just one of you mention rupaul's drag race or gaming or something cool???
my dad told me he's now registered republican and voting for trump because "he wants to see the world end"
at least he's aware of the end results and isn't like, "he's just so honest, he's the real voice of the people"
clinton campaign started it. clinton should not remind voters of her nasty 2008 campaign w/ obama
it was so nasty, vicious, mean, unfair that he appointed her secretary of state.
she actually looks pretty strong today. must be the steroids.
lol. i just don't get why you guys make these, only people that like them are already on board
looks like the thresholds are up a little bit.

my enjoyment of watching each case is directly proportional to the quality of the livestream.

the defense bar wanted to say that you need to take a look at each individual to see they have standing.
good and bad news for trump in the times/cbs news poll: voters see him as more transformative, but also riskier

questions for trump: why did trump go to wnd's joseph farah and say, "what can we do to turn the tide?" (source: 's nyt piece.)
and what specific evidence was he referring to when he said his investigators in hawaii found stuff people "wouldn't believe?"
sent this to spox, to ask how he will fulfill promise to give $5m if assured pres. obama born in us
fahrenhold's 1 of 20 wapo picked to create false trump narratives...will he have job aft election?

are you talking about the new iphone? lol.
jesus. trump is now taking reporters "on a tour" of his hotel. this is real life?

. show us where hillary wants to rescind the 2nd amendment. give a specific quote.
i always ask for the facts and get the response that some "alt-right" (white supremacist) website said it.
the media is rightly upset trump wanted to use them to advertise his new hotel today. everyone knows he's not divesting if he wins, right?
divesting? is that the same as "doubling down" in the trump family?
this is the current version i made years ago. inspired by jacque fresco's model
i'm going to work ...i'll check when i get back, and retweet any other examples you put up..
hey nfl, take notes.
shut the fuck up.
nice dig at and me in the new yorker. we're the "intellectuals" yet our views are not? via

‘twinks for trump’ creator wants to “make art great again”
great idea! fight back!
i agree with you esk on the h2h rewards looking nice now, but eb is right when it comes to non spenders, especially solos
the game is trash for people that dont spend money, you have to play h2h and win to get coins or just play alot
cry me a river. you have a great sense of humor.
lol, kenn, i am so mad. many of my friends are jobless, those with a job are underpaid &amp; someone is talking birth place

the fuck kinda hashtag is that . the davinci code
leave me alone it's for my science class 😅
you can argue today was good for trump the hotelier but no one with any knowledge of politics can say this was good for his campaign
the problem is people deciding whether to vote for him have no knowledge of politics though &amp; enjoy him fucking w/ media
freddy needs to get a job then!
i don't think he likes that idea
president ended the birther conspiracy theory that sick hillary started. he's a closer!
he ended it with style!

with all the songs he steals at his rallies, why is everyone talking about trump's bmi, when we should be concerned with his ascap?

max beer, (dear friend) met w death threats by hired domestic extremist hackers. fled to nepal.
it's frightening to realize that this guy founded the national review, and that it wasn't a recent fringe tcot creation.
yes! also, beside the point, what the hell was he doing with his hands?
loved this show so much. when i was a teen i wanted to marry , my sister wanted to marry
the thursday night line up was classic, martin, living single, new york undercover,
president obama has "no reaction" to trump's birther switch and is "shocked-well not that shocked that a question like that would come up."

fat stone golem go boom!
awesome, i love the eyes and the sense of weight you get from the animation!
reid fires back at trump for mocking the accident that partially blinded him:
i guess reid still is sensitive about his accident-perhaps he shouldn't throw stones-he sounds jealous

isn't it scary that the mainstream media aren't picking this up???
what's scarier is that the main street media purposely won't pick this story up.
dude. it took so. fucking. long.
just kidding. there's an app for everything. (glitchr)
i would love that! ☺️❤️
i'm all packed up just wondering what i'm going to be guided to do next. just a vague idea is all i have of what will be.
it's a great job, working here in the shop and wondering which cider/perry from which producer to try next with visitors.

i've said it before- girardi was on auto-pilot managing mo, soriano, miller, chapman. now his flaws are exposed. lineups big issue too.

there plenty of milquetoast crap to watch w/o furthering an actually dangerous narrative. rewatch lawrence welk, jfc people.
sorry to keep you waiting. we will deliver as soon as we are in your area. ^mh
no problem! it's not delayed :)
all fair points to my hyperbole, it's just been increasingly hard not to see fact-checking trump as futile
i agree with that. i don't think you can counter him with facts. at least not in print. curious about debates
you mean the way campaign illegally solicited donors from overseas, multiple times?
give us a break. ur queen takes millions from oppressive regimes that kills women &amp; gays. sold national security

next week trump will hold a press conference to distance himself from his rafael cruz/lee harvey oswald conspiracies.

flashback: hillary clinton, not trump, started the 'birther' movement against president obama
the msm is so up ass they refuse to acknowledge it.
i actually thought you were in new york.
i wish i'm stuck in the swampland
he would be solar powered. where is the coal fueled hero america needs?
"rejuvenated by the mother's milk of compacted carbon..."
would you expect anything less. 🍎📱
i would expect a more craft/local granola bar
of course you are
thank you for the response. i have my fingers crossed 🤘
and it is that will fix all what you just mentioned. you must be having a laugh.
for now, he has the inclination and msg to fix it. hillary has been there for 30 +yrs, no results as powel said
. "i want to see more money go to people"
more cash in people's pockets and less in government coffers! that's capitalism!
tried playing with today. don't think i'll be able to get into it. too slow/boring. fifa fans, why do you love it?
you have to know the game to really be into.

ha! i love it! need mine right now...
why on earth would anyone question obama's place of birth when michelle called kenya his home country?
: out of the horse's mouth, obama was born in kenya.
of which he was probably saving for breakfast. forgive me. it was delicious.
i have been thinking for a long time about what a sweet, cold burrito would look like. choco taco??viennetta??
i feel bad..i ordered a keurig for my dad's office and now it's becoming a fiasco cause we need a plumber to connect the water line.
its the thought that counts though :)
i don't anymore i am retired. living of my savings,investment. not collecting ss.
good for you! im not there yet
jocking around 😜
your ass in a jock is sublime!
when trump tries to deflect blame for denying that was born in america, he is lying.

my dispatch from the trump ballroom
wait - he replaced one lie with another, and then slipped in some unrelated lies. incorrigible
that thing he said about them... i don't think that is actually a thing.
it definitely is not
got my tix for brooklyn!
see you there!
is that you in the gif? the perfect picture of a drumpf supporter.
awww......did that one hit too close to home?? sorry about poor old sickly hillary.
that thing he said about them... i don't think that is actually a thing.
it never has been
now that's funny....hillary water carrier calling a liar. my oh my, where is her head?
julie your are most adept with your career knowledge, must you shadow it with your lack of courtesy?
are you here ?
r u serious! lol! gallstones attacking brain!
trump began by saying hillary started the birther issue and he finished it. she never personally questioned obama's birthplace
yes she did👎👎👎
thought making an iphone 7 appt. meant i could walk in. i was wrong! currently being publicly shamed outside the meatpacking district store.
maybe i'll pass the time by starting a tumblr of people gawking at the idiots in line as they walk by.

18 months into this cable networks are still letting trump hijack them for free airtime -- ad time -- by promising a "major announcement'
has manipulated the media &amp; has succeeded in taking the oxygen from the room with more bs than ever!

this trumpophobic disorder is getting real. cvs &amp; walgreen are selling trumpaquine xtra now, go get one
trump putting out policy proposals to help working families and move the country forward. hillary dragging us into the past.

wish it were. from trump's publicity-stunt, hotel-pitching, media-fooling event today.
i will be there if i have $. also i will miss the 2pm pirate today cause i had to deal with stuff.
i actually might go again haha
i so wanna believe this is turning point. but won't til i see much more evidence
they're only pissed because their producer couldn't go. if trump had let him, they would have caved. pathetic

thanks, have a great weekend!
we'll get it to you as soon as we can! it'll be worth the wait! *biancam
still doesn't fix my situation bianca. when being told it would ship out today
the issue is hillary's campaign started it..
that is completely false get educated. is that why she was obama's sos?
but the unlimited towing is money...
my mitsubishi came with roadside assistance
trump: the sky is not blue. media: is it blue? trump: tell you tomorrow. *hourlong full coverage* trump: it's blue. media: dammit!
yea if tomorrow = 8 years
looks like niko will miss oct 12 match vs houston since he got called to la celeste for wc qualifier
i would say one game is the right estimate.. other thing would be his condition coming back
her campaign did not start it. you're wrong. some of her supporters did but nor clinton or her campaign did. do ur research.
plus it was all internal no tv or press in on it,
wouldn't he be going back to drop her off?
that has been suggested, because something went wrong &amp; she didn't want to stay in the car.
donald 'solved' birtherism the way lance armstrong solved doping in cycling.
it was hard to do that without making a hitler analogy.
i admire those who play the long game to get back at their rivals.
this is incredible
lol, might as well party!!
sure spread the syrup
12 pm. . joining , , and .
lets talk about hrc deplorable insult,or destroying e-mail&amp; phone after court said 2 surrender them. or her sick act on 9-11
war draft dodging "bone spur" who insults prisoners of war - now being praised and endorsed by veterans. i'm confused.
has anyone fact checked with the “veterans”? trump says so many things that are in-true
what trump just did is a disgrace.
u need to do the same w/emails "doj exonerated me. end of story. now let's get back to smashing trump"
intelligentsia is complicated too though. like once upon a time i'd say a professor was intelligentsia. but now we have adjuncts.
professors that are teaching mankiw in harvard 101 econ are no "professors" they are bankster's toady's in drag
whaaaat i pay almost all our bills with checks!
like actual paper checks? with a time machine?
ok, enough times bashing from me. this is really great.
yea, except the lede on the ny times page says "he finally surrendered to reality." not what happened.
there's like 8 million charas kowai
and there's a good chance you'll get attached to at least five
embarrassed for the conservatives/gopers celebrating trump's birther con because it was good politics. the truth still matters.
your mind is full of elite guilt. no one gives a hoot about share obama was born. he himself doesn't have his original certif
i feel like they’re making us arbitrarily wait so they can give us a personalized experience that not everyone wants.
ah, i see. yeah, i understand that can be frustrating. “look i know what i’m doing, just hand over the phone, thanks!” :)
it's such a fine line because i agree- i feel like he's cost them wins, but if they make it he's obvi manager of the year
either way the future is bright for the 1st time in a long time. now go sign top line starters 2compliment the young lineup
i don't think you should self-censor because of security concerns; just get better at securing your conversations

wow of all people to defend trump. wow
glad you were in class today
it was great to be there. see you at 3
nobody with an iq above 40 believes this. trump ran a racist charade for years.
: you are full of dung. just ask his family in kenya, listen to his own video recorded admittances.
why is watching some white folks dance the worst and most awkward feeling imaginable
because reasons.
drinkss and food!!
definitely check out cedars! their lounge has a fabulous selection of cocktails &amp; craft beer plus delicious food
both of those have been debunked. hrc is getting deeper into trouble with fbi, foundation, health, seemingly endless scandals.
debunked =you his believe lies, no one else does. .&amp; trump's foundation is in a lot more trouble.
never fear, devoted readers: will be back writing a column.
jeff was at ct long before i started reviewing there in 2008, and in fact got me intro'd there in the first place. you're in good hands!

mr. dane... you can't fix stupid ignorance from one's that are the same as racist trump.
dear fellow deplorable... what am i missing? silly q. what is ctr? i'm only coming up with click through rate :)

what's the best way to send feedback about changes in beta? i don't like the longer method for getting notifications from an account
we needed a way to introduce more notifications options. so adding an extra step was necessary i think. what would you propose?

give me my 45 seconds back . smh
gawd kill me now
(2/2) the facts are clear: our nation’s economy is getting stronger.
you are so out of touch with the people
after trump non-ambiguously says obama born in usa, press essentially vows to chase trump to gates of hell over birther issue.
he says this after 5 years of pushing this and you don't think there are relevant follow up questions?
why do the republicans keep apologizing on the so called "birther" issue? no more apologies--take the offensive!
i think the reason to apologize for years of lies is pretty obvious
q1: give us a brief introduction about you. what do you do?

dear fellow deplorable... what am i missing? silly q. what is ctr? i'm only coming up with click through rate :)
sometimes,ctr counters bad reviews w/positive fake ones created by their minions,to whom they pay $10/hr
sometimes the return to routines means we get back to eating at home more &amp; have time to exercise regularly.

i'd be curious for katrina's interpretation. would you mind elaborating ?
katrina pierson about to elaborate....
if trump is that overweight wouldn't he be a diabetic?
i am sure that it is a matter of time. he's a ticking timebomb.
i just realized that there is a in chicago. if i wasn't already looking forward to my trip next week, i certainly am now!!!

no that's actually bill and hillary dressed up as a black woman
about the same time trump paid a settlements for discriminating against blacks.
well yeah, there's the whole "normalizing a racist, misogynist sociopath who would start a nuclear war" thing. that's bad
yep. but sadly, that's just par for the media course these last 18 months.
what trump just did is a disgrace.

new: trump's event started hour late. why? for part, he was huddled with bannon, bossie, eric, etc asking advice on obama birth remarks.
donald was asking eric for advice?
i do not think that it can be generalized. low-$ but also small portions.
kids portions in places i've visited recently are ~2/3 of adult, but cheap foods (pasta, grilled cheese, fries)

so, usually, the $10/hr. minions hold several accounts,different avi's, etc. and in this case,post positives abt hillary

thank you! is there a certain dish that defines the brunch experience for you?
- your caviar station, simply unparalleled, as i discussed in my article: -
why do they even need to be frozen?
you freeze so they last for months, grab one n throw it in your kids brown bag every day and it thaws by lunch
the fix: today a new low for journalism but for trump, he was the ringmaster at the circus. "it was peak trump."
. trump's birther circus.
found the water tower!
and how many were there?
no, jimmy fallon, donald trump isn't a laughing matter | steven thrasher

as i predicted this morning on : a brief reference, sweeping it away, on w business that matters.
very true-i heard it. hope fbn or fox gives good role on election night. your takes r refreshing😃😃
maybe the reason truth is becoming irrelevant in politics is because the truth is that politicians are losing their power.
. these are the two best ways to steal an election: either you control the identity registry (sybil attack) or generate gossip.

yeah, the nationally televised big events, now they are showing during every game. coincidence??? nope.
2 is a major problem. but i think pcon is a good person who is just misguided sometimes. 3 is a fact.
3 is an honest, sincere appeal to see who you're surrounded by and reconsider standing with them.
kids portions in places i've visited recently are ~2/3 of adult, but cheap foods (pasta, grilled cheese, fries)

q2: let's get into it. tell us in a nutshell what your concept of circle is about.
principle 1) ignorance - we begin by saying “i don’t know.” my customer my channel. my value prop.
why act as if getting high sends you to a trippy dimension where you can find yourself? bitch getting high is just chilling nothing more.
unless you eat an edible. those fuck you uo

principle 2) perspective comes from outside the building. from our customers and users.
creepy thin man from charlie's angels or big???? hope you're feelin 22 ily 🤘🏽💚
lmao thank you little. ily✌🏼️
do what you want. be real and honest about your shit. as long as you're honest, a person gotta respect you.
and if they don't fuck with it, oh well. at least you were real and gave them a choice.
nothing has said or done even comes close to what hrc has done in violating our national security

guise i love you but i'm not talking about a 1 star review by ppl who didn't like your book for no reason. i'm talking about literal nazis.
yes it stings when someone 1 stars &amp; galleys aren't even out. it's not the same as a crowd trying to tank your career based on your race.
q2: let's get into it. tell us in a nutshell what your concept of circle is about.
principle 3) build-measure-learn means 3.1) go faster 3.2) go backwards to go forwards.

the story isn’t that “trump now admits obama was born in america.” the story is “trump now admits he was lying for years.”
"all these years"? toure everything he says is a lie forever.
this is what would look like. we can stop it.
trully you are crazy.
did hillary really just say that trump doesn't consider blacks to be americans? my god.
her desperation is showing.
lol yea. i can't sleep in that class cause i sit in the front which is why he called on me.

mere weeks away from potential white nationalist president and here's the scene at nbc
since last night, 's poll ratings have dropped dramatically!
me: trump hotel cab driver: whats going on there? me: he's supposed to say obama was born here cab: and get publicity for his new hotel.
- that's all he's abt attention getting, showboating, bufoonery, exaggerating &amp; unadulterated lies!!
q4: how will you advice startups to use business model canvas?
the bmc is a tool to identify your assumptions. nothing more. don’t think of it like a fixed plan to follow.
. on trump event: "he's a salesman; took an opportunity to sell his business"
this and other news on w/ &amp; a very special guest from across the at wcbs-tv, woo-hoo!
q2 why is starting off the day with a nutritious breakfast important? ad

boy you're buggin, did you listen to 300 bars?
birtherism will play loudly and often to minority voters, also trump stupidly put obama on the ballot. a vote vs dt preserves first aa pres
who cares about the birtherism-theonly ones who care are dems-because clinton is failing in the polls
holy fuck you made this?
do you deliver?
autocorrect for 'npm' is ' mom's
just like mom there are gazillion other different package managers. err... no wait... i'm almost there but not quite.
trump’s bizarre claim that clinton started birther movement - wapo-no surprise trump would lie to get out of a jam

not even necessary. you delay this long, your cronies will readily assume that your hand was forced. *wink*
oh, i agree. but he'll still double down again. it's maybe the one thing he actually believes.
trump supporters likely regard that as a positive.
all he did was full the media to talk about something else than his taxes, econ plan and son comments about gas chamber.
q2 why is starting off the day with a nutritious breakfast important? ad
a2 the start of the day- keeps your engine going ad
breaking exclusive: 'hillary clinton campaign systematically overcharging poorest donors' via... by
talk about this, fox news.
q5: just a bit into what you have thought in the past. what do you term "minimum viable experience"? a new buzz?
all these buzzwords are not helpful. “minimum viable happiness” is as good as any other term. just go create value.
. fact-checks trump's claim that clinton starting
better late than never, i guess. hope its just not too little too late

of course. but trump didn't let her get away w another lie
ok, i see he's the bearer of truth.
nope 😎 but i'ma play it now and see.🎶🎤 the game don't impress me.
lol listen and then tell me what you think. top 5 diss track all time imo.
hmmm, i wonder what clintion had to say on when obama was actually running, when it mattered.
every day she was out on the campaign trail challenging obama's citizenship. it was deplorable.
djs - what's the worst confrontation you ever had with a requester?
i gave her a drink ticket to go away and she did not.
and your documented birtherism? hillary invented birtherism:
the great thing about these desperate tweets from hillary is we all just use them against her. they are such fools.

bush is bad nk? hillary and obama are worse
all she does is harp about bush. she has no valid argument.
clintons campaign definitely started the birther stuff its unfortunate how she has gotten away from the responsibility for that
"there is no record that clinton herself or anyone within her campaign ever advanced [birtherism]"
q6: to scale a business, any advice on how startups can more customers within and outside their geographies?

after trump non-ambiguously says obama born in usa, press essentially vows to chase trump to gates of hell over birther issue.
i don't trust anyone who was pushing the birther issue to have the judgment to be president. do you?

speaking of an school should be in the 👌
yes. pretty insightful. the guys a dirtbag who has tried to dodge taxes and funneled money to his daughters charity.

she was pretty cool on your show, but maaaan jimmy you've gotta check out. by any measure, waaay cooler than cl.
not sure the offense was the problem in buffalo. not great or anything, but lots of other issues too.
yeah. like the head coach
she started it - he helped finish it. obama is born in the us. let's move on to the real issues, like jobs, debt etc
i'm not ready to move on until the people of the united states and the gets a sincere apology. no more lies &amp; hate.

unhinged squawking of a madwoman who has just been btfo'd.

katz's interpretation.... or the man's actual words.. hard pass, bro beans.
you're a birther then? wow. you're such a moron on everything. trump could tell you anything and you'd believe it!
what do you mean?
it seems like we might be talking about two things? 1) the sw being out of whack 2) some sw members being defensive online
the active hours setting might let you get some work done (assuming you work between 1-12 hours!)
i have automatic updates turned off completely! none of that matters. and you never know when an update will take over sleep mode

jonah hill gets brutally roasted on live tv: [he has since canceled appearances..😦😦😦]
really can't blame him. that was definitely uncalled for.
trump: yes, i now agree that guns kill people. but also space aliens kill people, as we learned in the documentary star wars.
we would also have accepted independence day.
we're 2 years in and my series 1 still feels 99% capable as the most current model. nothing is making it feel technically obsolete

i'd say putting up 31 points on the 4th best defensive team from last year w/ a hobbled watkins and greg salas as your no. 2 is pretty good
